#!/usr/bin/env bash
# finding_verifier.sh — the wrapper finding_verify.py's --verifier contract asks for, and which did
# not exist. Reads findings JSONL on stdin, writes verdict JSONL on stdout:
#     {"id","verdict":"confirmed|false-positive|needs-debate","why"}
# With --audit it answers the drop-audit protocol instead:
#     {"id","verdict":"correct-drop|wrong-drop|uncertain","why"}
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: finding_verify.py runs whatever shell command you hand it. Until this file, the
# only commands that satisfied its protocol were the hardcoded stubs inside the lane suite, so the
# pipeline could only ever report status=UNVERIFIED (rc=3) against real findings. A pipeline whose
# only live path is its own fixture is not wired (CLAUDE.md §built-but-not-wired).
#
# 🟥 THE VERIFIER MUST SEE THE CODE, NOT ONLY THE CLAIM. A verdict on "is this finding real" that is
# reached from the claim text alone measures plausibility, not truth — the model agrees with a
# well-written wrong claim. So --target is REQUIRED and its content is put in front of the model.
#
# EXIT  0 answered · 2 usage · 3 the CLI failed or produced no parsable verdict (caller degrades;
#       finding_verify.py turns an empty answer into `unverified`, never into a silent pass)

# test_package_coverage_lanes.sh — regression anchor for scripts/package_coverage_check.sh.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (measured 2026-07-31):
#   package_coverage_check.sh gated itself on `[ ! -d .git ]`. In a git WORKTREE `.git` is a FILE
#   (a gitdir pointer), so every worktree fell into the "installed package" branch and the check
#   printed `SKIP` and exited 0 without scanning anything. That is a FALSE CLEAN of the worst shape:
#   a worktree is the standard way to approximate a fresh CI checkout, so the surface used to argue
#   "CI would be green" was precisely the surface on which this check silently did not run.
#   It was found by using the instrument, then asking whether the instrument had run at all —
#   CLAUDE.md §Instrument-Calibration, applied to FH's own tooling.
#
#   Second reason: selfcheck.sh enforces "subject present but anchor missing => FAIL" for eight
#   other scripts, and package_coverage_check.sh was the one subject exempted from its own rule.
#   An unanchored checker is one revert away from being decoration.
#
# The lanes pin, in order: the source-checkout predicate across all four tree shapes (worktree /
# ordinary checkout / package mode / no manifest), and a KNOWN PAIR — a tree that must FAIL and an
# otherwise identical tree that must PASS. A predicate that cannot separate that pair is not
# measuring coverage, it is emitting a verdict.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/test_package_coverage_lanes.sh
# Exit:   0 = no lane FAILED. 1 = a regression.
#         NOT "all lanes passed": a lane whose precondition is absent (no git) is counted as
#         UNCALIBRATED and printed in the summary, and exit stays 0. Stated precisely because the
#         earlier wording promised more than the code delivers, and an exit contract that overstates
#         is exactly the false-clean this suite exists to prevent (round-3 review, LOW).

# The synthetic fixture writes a gitdir pointer whose target does not exist, so it proves the
# predicate accepts "a file named .git" — not that it accepts a genuine worktree. This lane builds
# an actual repo and an actual `git worktree add`.
# ISOLATION (review round 2, LOW): the git commands run with signing off, hooks disabled, and both
# config files pointed at /dev/null, so a configured signing prompt or a global hook cannot hang the
# suite or write outside $TMP. GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 turns any credential prompt into an error.
# SKIP ACCOUNTING (review round 2, MED — confirmed by execution): the first draft printed a skip and
# incremented nothing, so a machine with a broken git reported "7 passed, 0 failed" and exited 0 —
# a lane that cannot run must not read as a lane that passed. Now: git ABSENT is a legitimate skip
# but is counted and surfaced as UNCALIBRATED in the summary; git PRESENT but setup failing is a
# FAILURE, because there the claim was testable and the test did not run.

# CONFIG isolation is not REPOSITORY-ROUTING isolation. Round-3 review reproduced this on Apple Git
# 2.50.1: with GIT_DIR pointing at an unrelated repo, this suite reported "8 passed, 0 failed" while
# that external repo's commit count went 0 -> 1. So the lane could pass by exercising — and WRITING
# TO — a repository that is not its fixture. A test that mutates state outside its own $TMP is not
# a test, and the green summary is the worst part: it reports calibration it did not perform.
# Every routing variable is cleared, and the resolved git-dir is then ASSERTED to live under $TMP
# rather than assumed — the unset list is a denylist and a denylist is never proof; the assertion is.
# SECOND LEAK CHANNEL, same class, found by the reviewer running the attack rather than reading for
# it: GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS injects config that GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL/SYSTEM=/dev/null does NOT suppress.
# Reproduced here: with `init.templateDir` pointed at a directory whose `refs` is a symlink to an
# external dir, `git init` populated that external dir — and the suite still printed
# "8 passed, 0 failed". The git-dir assertion cannot see this one, because the git-dir DOES resolve
# inside $TMP; the escape is through the template, not the routing. So the assertion is necessary and
# not sufficient, and the config-injection channels have to be closed by name.
# `--template=` with an empty directory is the belt to that braces: even if a config channel is
# missed, init has an explicit, empty template to copy from.

# test_count_check_readme_format_lanes.sh — known-pair anchor for the README format override guard
# in `scripts/count_check.sh`.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# `count_check.sh` is a **mandatory-pass** gate wired into selfcheck → prepublishOnly, pre-commit
# and CI. Its README check renders a caller-supplied printf template and uses the RESULT as a
# `grep -qE` pattern. Two ways that goes wrong, both measured 2026-08-12:
#   · a template rendering a NEWLINE turns the pattern into an OR search — a stale README (99/99)
#     PASSED because the trailing fragment "8" matched "Node 18" elsewhere in the file;
#   · `printf` failure and value-swallowing directives (`%.0s`) produced partial patterns, unchecked.
# The guard that closes this shipped with **zero** anchors in the same commit that added four
# anchors for a sibling fix — the exact "you can delete the feature and stay green" class that
# commit was closing. This file is that missing half.
#
# SCOPE, stated honestly: these lanes exercise the guard's DECISION LOGIC in isolation (render →
# inspect → accept/reject), not the whole count_check run. The full script needs a git worktree
# with a populated plugin tree; a fixture that lacks one fails for an unrelated reason ("0 active
# fh-meta skills") and every arm goes red for the SAME wrong cause — which is how a first attempt
# at this test nearly certified a guard that had not been exercised at all.

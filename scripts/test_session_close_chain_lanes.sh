# test_session_close_chain_lanes.sh — known-pair anchors for the close-chain steps that had NO
# mechanical lane: ① (status snapshot) · ①-b (open-PR sweep) · ④-log (real-time completion log, the
# only exit-1 FAIL path besides ⑤) · ④-b (npm freshness + BIDIRECTIONAL entry-point drift) ·
# and the pre-push SURFACE MATCHING (ordinary push advises · FH_SESSION_CLOSE=1 push blocks).
#
# Already anchored elsewhere, deliberately NOT duplicated here:
#   ②, ⑤ card-last          → scripts/test_session_close_lanes.sh
#   ⑤-b card-drift probe    → scripts/test_card_drift_probe.sh (incl. the locale-divergence leg)
#   pre-push stdin/ordering → scripts/test_prepush_stdin_integrity.sh
#
# CALIBRATION RULE OBSERVED THROUGHOUT: every lane that asserts an ABSENCE is paired with a
# known-POSITIVE built from the SAME fixture family, so "passed because the guard worked" is
# distinguishable from "passed because nothing ran". Exit codes are read DIRECTLY off the
# subject (never through a pipe — `cmd | tail; echo $?` reads tail's status and has produced
# false green in this repo four times).
#
# ⓘ GAP lanes: places where the subject's CURRENT behaviour is believed WRONG (fail-open, or a
# spec/code disagreement). They pin the observed behaviour but never fail the suite; if the
# behaviour changes they announce "GAP CLOSED" so the lane gets promoted instead of silently
# rotting. They are counted and printed separately — a green summary here does NOT mean the
# chain is fully guarded.
#
# Exit 0 = every asserting lane calibrated · exit 1 = the gate's instrument is wrong.

# 🟥 ENVIRONMENT ISOLATION (2026-08-27). `CLAUDE.local.md` INSTRUCTS this operator to export
# FH_COMPANION_STORE, so the suite inherited a REAL companion store and ⑤-C compared each FIXTURE
# card against the operator's actual prior card — reporting a carry-over loss that belongs to
# neither. Measured A/B on this file: exported → rc 1 with 6 exit-code lanes red · unset → rc 0.
# The verdict CONTENT was right every time (every `_line` assertion passed); only the exit code
# moved, which is what made it read like an over-blocking script rather than an ambient leak.
# 🟥 THIS IS THE SECOND FILE WITH THIS LEAK. The sibling test_session_close_lanes.sh was fixed
# earlier the same day and this one was not — a half-fix propagation boundary created by the same
# author who had just named that class. Fixed together now; the sweep that found it is
#   grep -l session_close_check scripts/test_*.sh   → check each for an FH_COMPANION_STORE guard.
# Lanes that genuinely exercise ⑤-C set their own fixture store ON the invocation and still win.
# 🟥 CLASS, NOT INSTANCE. The first draft of this guard unset FH_COMPANION_STORE alone — the one
# variable that had actually bitten. That is the same shape as the half-fix that put this guard in
# only ONE of two sibling lane files hours earlier. Every operator-settable override the subject
# reads is the same window, so all of them are closed here rather than one at a time:
#   FH_COMPANION_STORE  ⑤-C reads a REAL prior card and reports a carry-over loss on a fixture
#   FH_SESSION_CLOSE    flips advisory into blocking — every `expect exit 0` lane would go red
#   FH_CARRYOVER_OK     SKIPs ⑤-C — a lane asserting ⑤-C FIRES would go green for the wrong reason
#                       (note the direction: this one fails OPEN, which is the worse half)
#   FH_PEER_SCAN_FORCE  forces the ①-c peer scan on regardless of session shape
#   FH_PEER_SOCK_DIR / FH_REPO_ID   repoint peer discovery at the ambient machine
# CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT / CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION are deliberately NOT in this list: the subject uses
# them to detect session shape and the lanes that care unset them per-case on purpose (see the
# subject's own "NEGATIVE ARM UNVERIFIED" note). Blanket-clearing them here would silently change
# which branch those lanes exercise.

# went red on the two lanes the change broke rather than on the five it left unmeasured. Prose in a
# commit message is not a regression anchor: nothing re-runs it. Each pair below is
# known-positive (the instrument is blind) + a paired control (the clean line must NOT appear),
# because "the warning fired" and "the warning fired INSTEAD of a false all-clear" are two claims.
# KP-1 (the healthy case) is the ①-P lane at the top of this section.

# KP-2 upstream absent — `@{u}..` fails, prints 0 lines, and `wc -l` counts that 0 as "nothing
# unpushed". A commit that never left the machine reads as pushed. `--unset-upstream` (not
# `remote remove`) keeps a remote present, so the all-branch scan still runs: this isolates the

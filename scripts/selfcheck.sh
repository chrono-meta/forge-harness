# Class: mandatory-pass (harness_6axis_framework.md §Check classes) — blocks on fail.
# Scope: executables shipped via npm files[] + the bash infra driving the FH gate chain.
# NOT syntax-only any more, and this line used to say it was. Syntax checks (node --check / bash -n)
# are only the first section; behavioural lane suites follow and they DO have side effects and
# environment needs: temp dirs, a loopback HTTP stub on 127.0.0.1:18011, git, `timeout`, and — via
# the session-close lanes — an optional `gh` call that reaches GitHub when the binary is present.
# Corrected 2026-07-31 (cross-family review): the stale "zero side effects, no network" claim
# survived the additions that falsified it, which is how a reader ends up trusting the wrong
# invariant. No remote network is REQUIRED; some is possible.
# Wiring: `npm test` for any session; `prepublishOnly` so a publish cannot ship a

# ── The single verdict for "my subject is not here" ───────────────────────────────────────────
# Measured 2026-08-12 (card §🔱⑮ A2): **18 blocks in this file** rendered a green SKIP when their
# subject was absent, and **all 18 subjects are declared in package.json files[] and present in the
# real tarball** (verified with `npm pack --dry-run --json`, 20/20 — so routing them to FAIL cannot
# over-block a legitimate consumer). For a subject that always ships, "absent" cannot mean "package
# mode"; the only ways to reach it are DELETION or a broken install, and both were reported green.
# That is the fourth face of the axis the card names three of: 미측정→clean · 미측정→findings ·
# 해당없음→FAIL · **삭제→SKIP** — and it is the quiet one, which is why it survived longest.
#
# Two of the eighteen are worth naming because they read as already-handled and were not:
#   · the gate_pathspec block printed "— not-checked, NOT a pass" and then did not set fail. The
#     LABEL was honest and the VERDICT was green; a reader greps the message and believes it.
#   · the --self-test loop's comment says "never a silent pass" directly above the arm that was one.
# A comment asserting a property is not the property. Both were hand-verified by eye, not inferred.
#
# THE UNKNOWN ARM IS NOT A SKIP. `_ships_per_files` exits 2 when package.json is unreadable, and an
# unreadable manifest means we cannot tell deletion from package mode — `not found != 0`, so that
# case must not silently take the lenient branch (this repo's whole §Instrument-Calibration rule).

# ⚠️ KNOWN DEFECT, NOT FIXED HERE — `check()` above has the same evidence-discarding shape the

# called by every `node --check` / `bash -n` line in this file, so changing it changes the whole
# surface at once, which is a different job from repairing the four lane blocks (CLAUDE.md

# this whole repair exists to remove. The failing-line extraction finds it (1 hit, known pair).
# All four suites mark failures with `❌` (`no()` in sync_from_be_lanes.sh:21, `chk()` in the other

# gate-anchor harness — the SAME defect the block above documents, still open six days later.
# MEASURED 2026-08-16 (weekly_audit_2026-08-16.md 🟥-2): scripts/gate_anchor_check.sh has shipped in
# package.json files[] since 2026-08-10 (b18a2bf, PR #323) with ZERO callers — not selfcheck, not
# prepublishOnly, not .git-hooks/, not .github/, not npm scripts. Its only other mention is a comment
# line in a .cap adapter, which is not a call. So the one instrument this repo owns for asking
# "is the gate green for the RIGHT REASON?" was itself never green, never red, never run.
#
# 🟥 The detector did not see it: lane_runner_check.sh reports 46/46 wired · self-test 13/13, because
# this file is neither a lane suite nor a --self-test subject — it is OUTSIDE the detector's field of
# view, exactly like directional_diff_gate on 2026-08-15, and it survived that repair.
#
# ⚠️ Do NOT use "documented in a .md" as the wiring test: publish_freshness_check.sh has no reference
# in any TRACKED doc (knowledge/, docs/) and IS wired (prepublishOnly), and it blocked a publish on
# 2026-08-16. (An earlier draft of this line said "zero .md references" flat; that is false — three
# gitignored tracks/*.md files mention it. The thesis survives, the number did not, and Axis 3 caught
# it.) Call sites are the evidence; documentation is not. The first scan for this finding also missed
# templates/.git-hooks/* because those files carry no extension — scope corrected twice.
#
# Exit contract (from the script header): 0 = every known-pair held · 1 = a pair COLLAPSED (real
# defect) · 10 = harness error OR hooks-not-installed.
#
# 🟥 10 IS TWO DIFFERENT PROPOSITIONS AND THIS BLOCK MUST SPLIT THEM. gate_anchor_check.sh reaches
# `exit 10` from FOUR places, and only ONE of them is a legitimate consumer state:
#     :43  cwd/script repo mismatch      → harness defect
#     :99  mktemp failed                 → harness defect
#     :133 _fixture_fail (git init/seed/remote/origin-main)  → harness defect
#     :339 NOT_INSTALLED > 0             → legitimate: a package-mode consumer has no hooks
# Folding all four into a quiet SKIP is fail-open: a fixture collapse in THIS repo (a git default
# -branch policy change, a restricted TMPDIR, forced commit.gpgsign) would render byte-identically to
# a consumer who simply has no hooks. That is the "unmeasured → clean" move this file legislates
# against — and worse, the --self-test loop 200 lines below already routes rc=10 to `fail=1` saying
# "it could not measure, so its verdicts prove nothing". Same file, same code, opposite verdict.
# (Adversarial review 2026-08-16 found this. ⚠️ An earlier draft of this comment cited `:524` for
# it; the standpoint review measured the real sites — the loop dispatches at :528 and routes
# rc=10 to fail=1 at :562, and the quoted sentence lives at :429/:475. `:524` is none of them, so
# a reviewer following it lands on prose. A stale line number in the comment that argues against
# stale instruments is this commit's own defect class, recorded rather than quietly corrected.)
#
# The discriminator is mechanical, not a guess: the three harness-defect paths use plain `echo
# "❌ harness-error: …"`, while the NOT-INSTALLED path goes through `say()` which `--quiet` suppresses.
# Verified 2026-08-16: running the script from an unrelated git repo with --quiet returns rc=10 AND
# prints `harness-error` to the captured stream. So harness-error-in-output → FAIL; rc=10 without it
# → genuine NOT-INSTALLED → SKIP, labelled UNMEASURED and loud.
#
# ⚠️ NAMED RESIDUAL, not closed here: in CI this lane is structurally UNMEASURED. No workflow sets
# core.hooksPath (grep: 0 hits in .github/workflows/), so validate.yml's selfcheck step always lands
# on the NOT-INSTALLED arm — and `validate` is this repo's only required status check. A permanently
# SKIPPED lane in the one required check is worse than a permanently red one, because SKIP does not
# catch the eye. Fixing it is one line in validate.yml (set core.hooksPath before the selfcheck step)
# and is deliberately NOT bundled here — see the handoff. Until then the only real measurement arm is
# the author's machine, which is the exact shape portability_lint.sh was written to condemn.

# lane-runner — sibling of package-coverage one level up: that one asks "does the CONSUMER get the
# file a shipped doc names", this one asks "does ANYTHING execute the lane suite we wrote". Measured
# 2026-08-12 (reship axis, card §🔱⑮ A): 12 of 43 suites under scripts/ had no runner in selfcheck,
# the git hooks, or CI — including scripts/test_marker_crossfamily_lanes.sh, whose subject is a
# marker field that hard-blocks commits, and scripts/test_marker_floor_lanes.sh, whose subject is
# pre-commit's live validate_marker_floor(). Both gates ship; neither calibration had ever run.
# The card recorded this as three specific repairs needing "one anchor each"; wiring three anchors
# would have closed those three and stayed blind to the other nine and to the thirteenth. This runs
# unconditionally when present because its own absence is the defect class it exists to detect —
# there is no package-mode arm to skip into (a consumer running `npm test` should learn that a
# shipped suite of theirs is dead code just as much as we should).
# THREE-VALUED, and the third value exists because the two-valued version was this session's own
# instance of the defect it detects. The first draft was `if [ -f … ]; then run; fi` — an absent
# checker fell through to nothing, silently. That is "미측정을 0으로 렌더" reproduced by the commit
# that closed it: a 1.4.96 consumer has no lane_runner_check.sh (it was added to files[] AFTER that
# publish), so on their machine this block would have printed nothing at all and `npm test` would
# have reported a clean run of a check that never existed there.
# The three states are distinguished by the DECLARATION, not by the environment (same discipline as
# the pre-push block above): present → run · absent-but-declared-shipped → FAIL (deletion or broken
# install) · absent-and-not-declared → SKIP, saying so. For a 1.4.96 consumer the third arm is the
# correct and honest answer, and it names itself rather than being silent.

# ── the twelve suites lane_runner_check.sh measured as having NO runner (2026-08-12) ───────────
# The check directly above COUNTS them; this block is what makes the count go down. Until now the
# repo shipped a checker that reported its own todo list every run and nothing that discharged it,
# which is a decision surface only for as long as someone acts on it.
#
# What was actually measured before this wiring existed, because the size of the fact is the reason
# the block is here: all twelve pass when run by hand (rc=0, ~40s total), and NINE OF THE TWELVE
# ARE IN THE PUBLISHED TARBALL (`npm pack --dry-run --json`, 263 files). So a consumer running
# `npm test` was shipping-and-carrying nine test suites that nothing on their machine ever called.
# The two that hurt most: test_marker_crossfamily_lanes.sh calibrates the `crossfamily:` marker enum
# that hard-blocks commits, and test_marker_floor_lanes.sh calibrates pre-commit's live
# validate_marker_floor(). Both gates ship and block; neither calibration had ever executed.
#
# ONE loop, not twelve blocks, and that is deliberate: the four-value routing below would otherwise
# be hand-copied twelve times, and this repo has already measured what that produces — two copies of
# a normalizer drifting in leniency until one of them silently drops its input
# ([[feedback_divergent_leniency_duplicate_normalizers]]). The pair table is data; the verdict logic
# exists once. The existing SessionStart pair-loop below/above uses the same shape.
#
# FOUR values, and every arm is reachable on a real machine:
#   subject absent        → _absent_subject_verdict (deletion vs package mode, decided by files[])
#   anchor present        → run it. exit 10 is called out separately: several of these suites use it
#                           for "I could not set myself up" (mktemp failure), which is not a lane
#                           failure and must not be reported as one — it still sets fail, because a
#                           harness that could not measure did not pass ([[not_found_is_not_zero]]).
#   anchor absent+shipped → FAIL. Deletion or broken install, exactly like the block above.
#   anchor absent+unshipped → SKIP, naming itself. Three anchors genuinely do not ship
#                           (chamber_run · frontier_digest_retry · residency_closure), so for a
#                           consumer this arm is the honest answer, not a dodge.
#
# Subject choice is the file whose behaviour the suite pins, so that deleting the subject routes to
# "your install is broken" rather than to a green run of a test about nothing.
# test_capability_entrypoint_shipping.sh pins two (degrade_probe_capability.sh and
# psa_probe_capability.sh); degrade is named here as the sentinel — the suite itself checks both and
# fails if either is gone, so nothing is lost by not listing both in this table.
# test_script_caller_ratchet_lanes.sh is the second of that shape: it pins BOTH
# scripts/script_caller_ratchet.sh (the checker) and scripts/ratchet_base_resolve.sh (the base
# resolver its L24–L26 lanes execute), and it hard-exits 1 naming the missing file if either is
# gone. The checker is the sentinel because it is the one whose absence means the gate itself is
# gone; the resolver's absence is a narrower failure the suite still reports by name. Neither
# script ships — both, and this anchor, are declared in package_coverage_check.sh ACCEPTED_ABSENT.
# On a consumer install the SUBJECT arm fires first and `_ships_per_files` returns 1, so the row
# resolves to "SKIP (subject not in files[], and absent)" — the anchor arm is never reached.

# invisible for a reason worth keeping written down: lane_runner_check.sh reported it WIRED off the
# subject's OWN usage comment (`#   bash scripts/directional_diff_gate.sh --self-test`), so the
# report read `self-test: 10/10 wired` while `grep -rn directional_diff_gate` across every runner
# surface returned zero real callers. The detector was repaired in the same delta as this wiring
# (has_selftest_runner now skips the subject's own file, selftest_dispatched now drops comment
# lines — the two guards has_runner/runner_dispatches always had), which is why the two halves ship
# together: fixing the detector alone would have left a real debt item newly VISIBLE and still
# unrun, and wiring alone would have left the detector able to certify the next such subject.
# ⚠️ The cost of shipping both halves at once, named rather than left for the next reader to
# discover: the report reads `10/10` before the change and `10/10` after it, so the detector repair
# is NOT observable from this repo's own run — reverting the repair alone leaves the count
# unchanged, because the wiring that now exists is real. Its only evidence is the fixture lanes
# L14–L16 in scripts/test_lane_runner_lanes.sh, which is why L16 in particular is load-bearing:
# delete it and the self-exclusion guard has nothing anywhere that would go red.
#
# NOT in the `for _subj in ...` loop above, and that is the same call made for
# capability_registry_check: that loop gates on the substring 캘리브레이션, and this subject's
# terminal verdict is English ("✅ calibration passed (N pairs)"). Adding it there would produce
# "dispatcher missing?" — a confident and wrong cause — for a suite that passes. Gate on exit code
# instead, same shape as the two blocks above. It carries genuine HARNESS-ERROR paths (`exit 10` on
# mktemp failure, `return 10` on unreadable input), so a setup failure must not read as a lane
# failure. Ships via package.json files[] with no ACCEPTED_ABSENT declaration, so absence is
# deletion, not package mode. `< /dev/null` for the same stdin-wait reason the loop above documents.

# gate-pathspec anchor — wired here 2026-08-04. It was reachable ONLY from templates/.git-hooks/
# pre-commit, i.e. only in a clone where the operator had run `git config core.hooksPath`. Every
# other clone, every CI run, and the npm package carried the anchor file and never executed it —
# the built-but-not-wired shape, one layer up: the anchor for the gate had no anchor of its own.
# That mattered the same day: PR #254 added five known-pairs to it, all of which would have been
# unexecuted outside the author's machine.
# Subject = the two implementations it reads (the hook's HEAVY term and the guard's GUARD_PATHSPEC).
# Absent subject → package/partial surface → legitimate SKIP; present subject with the anchor gone
# → FAIL, same shape as every block above.
# NAMED RESIDUAL (cross-family, gpt-5.5, 2026-08-04): if a distribution that SHOULD be complete
# accidentally drops one subject, this reports SKIP, not FAIL — silent non-coverage. Measured the
# same day: removing `templates/.git-hooks` from package.json `files[]` and running
# scripts/package_coverage_check.sh still PASSED, so no existing anchor catches that omission
# either. Deliberately NOT patched with a stricter branch: the only discriminator available
# ("templates/ exists but the hook does not") would be built on an UNMEASURED assumption about how
# a narrower package is shaped, and this repo's rule is not to build before the constraint is
# measured. What is cheap and honest is naming WHICH subject is missing, so a SKIP is diagnosable
# instead of opaque. Revisit when a real partial distribution is observed.

# this loop implements: that entry's "selfcheck reports it NOT EXERCISED (exit 2)" describes the
# anchor RUNNING and finding no CLI (handled a few lines below, rc==2). It never claimed anything
# about the anchor FILE being missing — a real consumer never gets to run it at all (the file is not
# in files[]), and this loop had no branch for that at all, so every installed package hit
# "FAIL … anchor is missing" (corrected 2026-08-12, cross-family review — an earlier revision of this
# comment miscited the ACCEPTED_ABSENT entry as already covering the missing-file case). Fixed by
# consulting the SAME declaration (`_pkg_accepted_absent`, loaded once near the top of this file) that
# the ref-path block above uses — not an environment predicate — because `.git` presence answers "is
# there a git repo here", not "was this anchor declared intentionally unshipped", and the two diverge
# in a git-tracked vendored tree (a monorepo committing node_modules, `git init` after install): `.git`
# exists there too, which would silently reproduce the original FAIL.
# test_wizard_snippet_merge_lanes.sh is NOT in ACCEPTED_ABSENT (it does ship, per files[]) — routing
# both anchors through the same declaration lookup, rather than hardcoding one as always-FAIL, means a
# future person who genuinely needs to exempt it does so by editing ONE list, not by finding this loop.

  # ── RUN-ONCE, CAPTURE — canonical note for the four LANE BLOCKS (2026-08-05) ─────────────────
  # SCOPE, stated precisely because the first draft of this note over-claimed: this covers the four
  # lane blocks only (tag-version · dispatch-log · selfcheck-state · sync_from_be). The same
  # evidence-discarding shape SURVIVES in `check()` at the top of this file and in the
  # probe_scope_check caller — both named there, both deliberately out of scope, both still open.
  # An adversarial round caught the original "all four sites in this file" wording as a false
  # completion claim: it would have stopped the next reader from re-searching. Half a fix with a
  # done-label on it is worse than half a fix.
  # The old form ran the suite twice: once discarded to /dev/null to decide, once re-run to print.
  # For a DETERMINISTIC suite that is merely wasteful. For a non-deterministic one it destroys the
  # evidence: the failing run's output goes to /dev/null and the reader is shown the SECOND run,
  # which may pass. Measured here 2026-08-04 (run 30955950695) — CI printed
  #     FAIL  sync_from_be_lanes.sh: return-path lanes failed
  #     ════ lanes: 70 passed · 0 failed ════
  # i.e. a FAIL verdict over a PASSING transcript, and the actual failure was never recorded
  # anywhere. That is why this lane sat "flaky, cause unknown" on the session card for two days:
  # the instrument was discarding the only evidence that could close it. Reproduced as a known
  # pair before this edit (arm A run-twice → evidence lost + self-contradiction; arm B run-once →
  # evidence preserved), so the fix is anchored, not asserted.
  # NOTE this does NOT make the suite deterministic — the underlying non-determinism is still
  # UNDIAGNOSED and stays an open item. It makes the next occurrence diagnosable instead of
  # self-erasing. Do not read a green CI after this change as the flake being fixed.

# Referenced-path existence is a source-tree check. The npm package intentionally
# ships a narrower runtime surface, so package-mode selfcheck skips this section.
# ⚠️ The skip predicate used to be `[ -d ".claude/rules" ]`. That broke the moment the tarball
# started shipping PART of that directory (`.claude/rules/fh_4axis_gate.md` etc. are in files[]) —
# the directory then exists in BOTH source and package mode, so the check never skipped in package
# mode at all. It ran, extracted refs from the shipped CLAUDE.md/.claude/rules/*.md (which still
# name `.claude/regression/ablation_verdicts.md` and `scripts/probe_scope_check.sh` — both
# deliberately unshipped, per package_coverage_check.sh's own ACCEPTED_ABSENT list), then tried
# `git check-ignore` against a tree with no `.git` at all (a real `npm pack` tarball is not a git
# repo) — that call errors rather than confirming "ignored", so the fallback `[ -f "$p" ]` ran and
# correctly found nothing, and the check reported FAIL on two paths it had already been told, one
# check over, were fine to omit. First fix (2026-08-12, reship axis, card §🔱⑮ G/D) swapped the skip
# predicate for `[ -e .git ]`. Cross-family review then caught that `[ -e .git ]` answers a different
# question than the one this check needs: a git-TRACKED vendor of this package (a monorepo that
# commits node_modules, or a consumer who runs `git init` after installing) has `.git` and IS a
# legitimate package consumer, yet the predicate would route it into the full extraction and
# reproduce the exact original FAIL on these same two paths — the fix would have closed the bug only
# in the one shape it was tested against. The general fix is not a better environment predicate; it
# is not re-deriving "is this legitimately absent" from the environment at all when a DECLARED answer
# already exists — `_pkg_accepted_absent()`, loaded once near the top of this file — this block now
# consults it before FAILing, so the two paths render SKIP regardless of how `.git` happens to be
# shaped in the consumer's tree. `[ -e .git ]` still gates whether the SCAN runs at all (an installed
# package with no tracked-refs source to lint), which is a real and unrelated question.

  # Backtick-quoted repo-relative file refs in the always-loaded governance surface
  # (CLAUDE.md + .claude/rules/*.md) must exist. Phantom-reference class recurred
  # N>=3 in the 2026-06-11 audit window — instrument-not-habit.
  # Extract first, then count. Streaming the extractor straight into the loop meant an
  # extractor that produced nothing (CLAUDE.md absent, 2>/dev/null swallowing a grep error,
  # the backtick convention changing) ran the loop zero times, printed nothing, and left
  # fail=0 → SELFCHECK: PASS. The check would have silently ceased to exist while still
  # reporting a pass — the same shape count_check.sh:71 already guards against with its
  # impossible-zero rule. fh-meta always has refs; zero means the instrument broke.
  # EXTRACTION MOVED OFF grep (2026-07-31, measured on the first real CI run). The pipeline used to
  # be `grep -hoE` + sed + `grep -E` over CLAUDE.md, which is Korean-heavy. On macOS (BSD grep, UTF-8
  # locale) it returned ~50 refs; on the ubuntu runner (GNU grep, LANG unset => C locale) it returned
  # ZERO, and the impossible-zero guard below is the only reason that surfaced as a failure instead
  # of "no refs, all clean". Same root cause as the card-drift probe failing its positive lanes in
  # the same run: multibyte text through locale-dependent grep.
  # python3 reads the files as UTF-8 explicitly, so this extractor no longer has a locale at all.
  # It is already a hard dependency of selfcheck (validate_plugins/marketplace, memory_link_check),
  # so this adds nothing to the requirement set. The regex is the same one, transcribed.

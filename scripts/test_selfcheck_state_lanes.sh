# test_selfcheck_state_lanes.sh — known-pair anchor for selfcheck's subject-presence blocks.
#
# WHY (2026-08-02): selfcheck decides, per wired lane suite, whether an absent file means "package
# mode, legitimately skip" or "source tree, the calibration was deleted — FAIL". Getting that
# discriminator wrong is not a small error in either direction:
#   · too permissive → a source tree silently stops running a control and still prints PASS. That is
#     the shape this session found twice (an anchor with no caller; a control that never ran).
#   · too strict → every consumer's `npm test` hard-fails. That is the shape this session ALSO found:
#     `.claude/rules` was used as the package discriminator on the belief it does not ship, and it
#     does (`package.json` files[] carries `.claude/rules/fh_4axis_gate.md`), so the SKIP arm was
#     unreachable and the FAIL arm misdiagnosed a package as a source tree.
# Both were caught by an adversarial read, not by a test — every other guard under scripts/ has a lane
# suite and this decision had none. This file is that suite.
#
# It tests the DISCRIMINATOR LOGIC, not selfcheck end-to-end: a full run takes >2 minutes and its
# other suites are anchored separately. Each lane extracts the real branch condition from
# scripts/selfcheck.sh and evaluates it against a synthetic tree, so a future edit to the condition
# is what the lane sees.
#
# Exit 0 = all lanes hold · 1 = a discriminator would mis-route.

# SCOPE of these four lanes, stated because the inherited §SCOPE block below is about a different
# anchor and does not cover them. The lift is the `0)` arm's BODY only, so these lanes see a change
# to the verdict predicate and are blind to the routing around it: widening `case ... in 0)` to
# `0|1)`, dropping `< /dev/null`, dropping the `$_LANE_TO` wrapper, or deleting the rc=124
# HARNESS-ERROR arm all leave every lane here green. Those are guarded by review, not by this file.
# The `_pre` control is also a RE-SPELLING of the pre-repair form rather than a lift of it — it has
# to be, since that form no longer exists in the subject to lift, but it means the control asserts
# what the old code did from memory. Both limits found by cross-family review, 2026-08-15.

# ── SCOPE OF THIS ANCHOR — stated so it is not over-trusted ───────────────────
# These lanes catch REVERSION (the run-twice form coming back, the helper being gutted, the
# call-site redirect returning). They do NOT catch deliberate EVASION: a cross-family round
# demonstrated three forms that satisfy every check above while still destroying evidence —
# `_out=$(bash suite >/dev/null 2>&1)` (executed once, captured nothing), a wrapper function
# (`run_lane() { bash scripts/X.sh; }`, literal appears once, runs twice), and redirect spellings
# the greps do not enumerate (`1>/dev/null`, a variable). Chasing those with more patterns is the
# Grep-Collision Treadmill this repo has already logged as P10 — each added regex relocates the
# evasion instead of closing it. It is bounded rather than escalated: an evading form still routes
# through _show_failure, whose empty branch prints "(no output captured)" at runtime, so the failure
# is loud rather than silent. Regression is anchored; evasion is a named residual, not a solved one.

# Lift the REAL function out of selfcheck.sh and call it — a re-spelled copy would stay green

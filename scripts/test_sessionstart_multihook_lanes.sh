# test_sessionstart_multihook_lanes.sh — what actually happens when SEVERAL SessionStart hooks are
# registered on ONE matcher.
#
# WHY: this repo's .claude/settings.local.json registers three SessionStart commands on a single
# matcher, and CLAUDE.md leans on that wiring ("hook-backed via scripts/fh_session_load.sh"), yet the
# multi-hook behaviour had never been demonstrated. Four questions were open: ORDER, whether one
# failing hook blocks the others, whether stdout INTERLEAVES or is CONCATENATED, and whether a
# non-zero exit is visible at all. They are answered here by running the real `claude` CLI, because
# no amount of reading settings.json answers any of them.
#
# INSTRUMENT — two channels, deliberately:
#   (a) TYPED: `--output-format stream-json --verbose` emits one `hook_response` object per hook with
#       {exit_code, outcome, stdout, stderr}. This is a machine channel, not prose-grep.
#   (b) DELIVERED: the assistant's own final text, which measures what reached the AGENT. (a) and (b)
#       are different propositions — the harness capturing a hook's output is not the same as the
#       session receiving it — and the gap between them is the finding.
#   Channel (b) is model-mediated, so it is only trusted through an IN-RUN control: the same reply
#   must list its sibling markers. A model that simply answered lazily would drop all of them.
#
# COST: two `claude -p` calls on the cheapest model, a few hundred tokens each. Network + auth
# required.
#
# EXIT CODES — three-valued on purpose:
#   0 = every lane calibrated · 1 = a lane FAILED · 2 = NOT EXERCISED (no CLI / no auth / opted out).
# 2 is never a pass. A suite that cannot run must not be readable as a green one.
#   Opt out with FH_SKIP_LIVE_CLAUDE=1 (still exits 2).

# B: instant + configurable exit — the hook under test.
# C: instant + exit 0 — the sibling that must survive B.
# D: a command pointing at a script that DOES NOT EXIST (bash exits 127). This is not hypothetical:
#    it is the shape of a stale settings.json entry, and this repo has one today.
#    🟥 D is the ONE hook here that prints no marker of its own, so the queries below find its

#    there for a 127 ("exit 127, a shell's code for a program it could not run; the hook's stderr is
#    left out", measured on 2.1.319), so bash's own message — and any substring of this fixture's

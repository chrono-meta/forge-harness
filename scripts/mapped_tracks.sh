# mapped_tracks.sh — the ONE mechanical answer to "how many field harnesses are mapped in this hub?"
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (measured 2026-08-22, known-pair in one run):
#   main checkout : 11 mapped tracks
#   a worktree    :  1
# The mapping signal is the PRESENCE of `tracks/<name>/`, and that signal cannot survive into a
# worktree for two independent reasons: (a) `tracks/**` is gitignored, and (b) at least one mapped
# track (`pmh-dev`) is an EMPTY directory, which git cannot carry even if it were tracked. So a
# worktree does not have a smaller count — it has a STRUCTURALLY BLIND one.
#
# WHY THAT WAS SILENT: the synergy skill's Step 3-b closes as `run(n pairs)` or
# `skipped(<2 mapped tracks)`, and BOTH are mandatory-pass values. A worktree run therefore closed
# GREEN while blind — the same shape as the ①-c peer-detection defect fixed the same day, on the
# instrument that grades identity ④ itself.
#
# MECHANIZED AT N=2 BY CLASS, NOT BY COUNT: `operations.md` allows mechanization at "N>=3 **or the
# same class recurring on another surface**". This class (a count over gitignored, un-committable
# state read from cwd instead of the repo's common root) hit two distinct surfaces on 2026-08-22 —
# ①-c peer placement and Step 3-b mapped-track counting. Recorded here so the threshold is not
# claimed loosely.
#
# NOT-FOUND IS NOT ZERO. If the root cannot be resolved or `tracks/` is not there, this exits 3 with
# status=UNMEASURED. It never prints `count=0` for a question it could not ask.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/mapped_tracks.sh [--count-only]
# Exit:  0 = measured · 3 = UNMEASURED (a NON-PASS; never fold into "0 mapped") · 2 = bad usage

# ── ⓐ SESSION FILES, and the branch verdict ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# WHY THIS IS HERE AND NOT IN PROSE. The onboarding branch test has two halves: ⓑ (mapped tracks,
# counted above) and ⓐ (session files). ⓑ has been mechanical since 2026-08-22; ⓐ was left to the
# session to judge from a sentence — and the sentence was wrong.
#
# 🟥 THE DEFECT, measured 2026-08-30 with a control. ⓐ read «any `tracks/**/session_*.md` or
# `tracks/_meta/*.md` beyond .gitkeep», and TWO files that SHIP WITH THE REPO satisfy it:
#     tracks/_contrib/session_2026_06_27_….md      (a sister-asset cross-audit; only the NAME is
#                                                    session-shaped)
#     tracks/_meta/harness_bench_issue_monitor.md   (an issue-monitor artifact)
# So `git clone` alone rendered the RETURNING menu, and the NEW-USER branch was unreachable for
# anyone who clones. The canon warns two lines away that «a fresh clone is a NEW install — never
# infer the branch from git log»; the same misreading arrived through tracked FILES instead.
# (Control: the nonsense pattern `tracks/**/zzz_*.md` matched 0, so the probe discriminates.)
#
# THE RULE, one sentence: **ⓐ counts only files that did NOT ship with the repo.** Content that
# arrived with the checkout is not evidence that this person has worked here. `git ls-files` is the
# mechanical discriminator, and it degrades honestly: an npm install ships no `tracks/` at all
# (verified against package.json `files[]`), so both worlds agree.
#
# 🟥 THREE-VALUED. "cannot tell shipped from user-made" is UNKNOWN, never `new` — rendering an
# unmeasured state as the friendlier branch is how a returning user gets told they look new
# ([[feedback_not_found_is_not_zero_family]]).

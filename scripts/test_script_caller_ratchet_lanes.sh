#
# 🟥 EVERY LANE RUNS AGAINST A FIXTURE ROOT, NEVER AGAINST THIS REPO.
# The checker takes `--root DIR` for exactly this reason. A lane that scanned the real tree would
# pass or fail on whatever the tree happens to contain today, which is a lane that measures the
# repo instead of the instrument — a trap this repo has fallen into before. Lane L0 is the control
# that proves the swap actually took: it asserts the fixture's own population size, so if `--root`
# were ignored and the real repo were scanned, L0 goes red instead of everything silently passing.
#
# The pairs are deliberate: every blocking lane has a known-negative twin, because "it blocked" is
# not the same claim as "it blocked for the right reason", and an over-blocking gate trains the
# override into muscle memory.

# 🟥 ONE TEMP ROOT FOR THE WHOLE SUITE, and every fixture is a child of it.
# Two reasons, both measured in this repo rather than assumed:
#   · a sibling lane suite leaked fixture writes into the real tree, so "the fixtures are under
#     mktemp" has to be a property of a single named root that can be printed and removed as a unit,
#     not of N independent mktemp calls scattered through the file.
#   · the trap removes the root on ANY exit path, including a lane that dies mid-fixture. The old
#     per-lane `rm -rf "$d"` runs only when the lane reaches its own last line.
# The per-lane `rm -rf "$d"` calls below are KEPT: they bound peak disk during the run, and a
# belt-and-braces cleanup is not a duplicate normalizer — neither one changes any verdict.

# Each fixture is a throwaway root with its own scripts/ — no inheritance from this repo.
# 🟥 THE RUNNER LIVES IN .github/workflows/, NOT IN scripts/. First draft put it at
# scripts/runner.sh and eight lanes went red for a reason that had nothing to do with the lane: the
# runner is itself a non-lane script under scripts/, so it entered its own population with no caller
# and every fixture blocked on IT. The fixture, not the checker, was wrong — and it is worth keeping
# written down, because a green version of that fixture would have been the worse outcome.
# 🟥 2026-08-31: this helper returned an EMPTY string when its trap fired first (SIGTERM during a
# selfcheck sweep), and every `git -C "$d"` below then resolved to the CURRENT DIRECTORY — the live
# repo. A fixture lane committed 127 lines of a session's uncommitted work onto its real branch,
# with `--no-verify` and a bogus hooksPath, so no gate saw it. `git -C ""` is fail-OPEN by
# construction: an absent path is not an error, it is "here".
# The guard below is deliberately about the INVARIANT, not the symptom — a fixture must never write
# to a real repo — so it also catches a $d that is non-empty but wrongly points at one.

# ── L28 — A `SUBJECT|ANCHOR` PAIR DISPATCHES ONLY THE ANCHOR ──────────────────────────────────
# WHAT THIS CLOSES. scripts/selfcheck.sh drives its suite list as `"SUBJECT|ANCHOR"` strings and
# its body does `_subj="${_pair%%|*}"; _anc="${_pair##*|}" ... bash "$_anc"` — the SUBJECT is only
# `[ -f ]`-tested, never run. Shape 2 (for-list) credited BOTH sides, so a script that merely
# appears as a subject was reported WIRED.
# Cost, measured twice on the same file: on 2026-08-26 the ratchet told a session to delete
# scripts/chamber_candidate_collect.sh from `baseline:` — a section whose whole meaning is "still
# owes a PRODUCTION caller" — and a cross-family review had to revert it. On 2026-08-30 the same
# advisory fired again on the same file, and the only thing that prevented a second deletion was
# the note that reviewer had left behind. These two lanes replace that note with a check.

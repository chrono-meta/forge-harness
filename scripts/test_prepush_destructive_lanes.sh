# test_prepush_destructive_lanes.sh — known pairs for the pre-push hook's DESTRUCTIVE-OP verdict.
#
# ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (the hole it closes) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# CLAUDE.md §Destructive-Op Gate names `templates/.git-hooks/pre-push` as the MECHANICAL FLOOR for
# the git-side irreversible surfaces (remote branch delete · force / non-ff push · tag delete), and
# is explicit that `templates/predelete_check.sh` is the operator's HUMAN enumerate tool which no
# hook executes. So the floor is the hook's own inline per-ref verdict block (pre-push:595-677 —
# banner at :595, `BLOCK=0` at :598, file ends :677; re-measured 2026-08-22, the old "600-676"
# was approximate).
#
# Measured 2026-08-22, bookshelf pass before writing a line of this file:
#   • scripts/test_destructive_pre_gate_lanes.sh anchors scripts/destructive_pre_gate.sh — the
#     PreToolUse *advisory text-pattern* guard over a proposed command. A DIFFERENT subject.
#   • scripts/prepush_guard_check.sh anchors the same hook but only its PUBLISH boundary: all 20 of
#     its pairs are confidentiality / main-PR-only / tag-version. Grepped for delete|force verdict
#     pairs: ZERO — measured with a known-positive control (the same grep hits 14 times in THIS
#     file, so the zero is a measurement and not a dead grep).
#     ⚠️ "13" stood here until 2026-08-22 and was wrong; the count is 20. The `ZERO` half was
#     re-measured with the control above and survived. A count nobody re-runs decays silently.
#   • templates/predelete_check.test.sh anchors the enumerate tool, and WAS executed by nothing.
#     ⚠️ Corrected 2026-08-22 R2: that present-tense claim went stale the same day it was written —
#     .github/workflows/destructive-op-anchor.yml step 'Anchor 3/3' now runs it, and stage ⑥ of
#     scripts/test_prepush_destructive_liveness.sh guards that runner. A file describing its own
#     machine in a tense that no longer holds is [[feedback_rule_misdescribes_its_own_machine]];
#     it is left visible as a correction rather than quietly overwritten.
#   ⇒ The inline block that actually blocks a force-push or a branch delete had NO known-pair
#     anchor anywhere, and therefore never re-ran in CI. An anchor that never re-runs cannot tell
#     you the gate broke; it tells you it was correct once, on the author's machine.
#
# ── DISCIPLINE THIS SUITE INHERITS FROM ITS SIBLING (scripts/prepush_guard_check.sh) ──────────
#  (a) Run the hook FOR REAL. `bash -n` is not an instrument: a `${...}` bad substitution is a
#      RUNTIME fault that parses clean, aborts the hook, and still exits 0 — every push allowed.
#  (b) A runtime fault is checked BEFORE the verdict, else an aborted hook scores as a clean pass.
#  (c) "It blocked" is NOT "it blocked correctly". A missing dependency also exits non-zero and
#      would score every BLOCK pair green while the gate was broken. So a block must NAME a
#      destructive cause; a block for a harness reason is reported as its own distinct failure.
#  (d) A pass must show its marker line — proof the hook ran far enough to make a claim. A hook
#      killed by a signal prints no fault text and rc alone would read as a pass.
#
# ── 🟥 WHAT THIS SUITE CLAIMS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT (narrowed 2026-08-22 R3) ──────────────────
# It claims: on THESE 12 constructed inputs, the hook reached a verdict, the verdict matched the
# expected direction, and the hook ATTRIBUTED it to the named cause. That is a known-pair anchor.
# It does NOT claim to be an analyzer of the hook's execution semantics. Two places where this
# suite, like its liveness control, matches FORM rather than meaning — named rather than implied:
#   • (a)/(b)'s runtime-fault detector is a fixed vocabulary of bash's own error strings
#     (bad substitution · unbound variable · syntax error · command not found). A runtime fault
#     that words itself differently, or one whose message goes to a closed fd, is not recognised
#     and the lane falls through to the verdict check. Deliberately a vocabulary and not a
#     `set -e` harness: the failure it guards against (a parse-clean `${...}` fault aborting the
#     hook while it exits 0) does emit one of these, and every widening of the list adds false
#     "RUNTIME FAULT" reds on hooks that merely print the word.
#   • (c)/(d)'s attribution is `grep` over the hook's own output. It establishes that the hook
#     SAID the cause, not that the code path that said it is the one that decided.
# Neither is a defect to be repaired by a bigger regex — a regex chasing shell semantics loses at
# the edges in both directions at once, which is the class that produced the R3 findings. The
# thing that settles these is the hook running for real against a real destructive ref, which is
# what each lane below actually does.
#
# Runs entirely in mktemp throwaway repos: never touches this repo's index, worktree, or refs.
# Portability: git + coreutils only. No `stat -f` (BSD-first breaks the Linux runner), no
# `|| echo 0` pipefail fallbacks (that disarms the very guard being measured).
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_prepush_destructive_lanes.sh   → exit 0 all pairs hold, 1 otherwise.

#      the hook. Two lanes now, because they assert different things:
#        P6a — the SAFETY property on the path a real push takes: it fail-closes. Whichever guard
#              wins, the push does not proceed. This is what protects the operator.
#        P6b — the destructive branch itself, reached by unshadowing the earlier guard with
#              PUBLIC_SURFACE_OK=1. Without this lane that code path is UNMEASURED, and an
#              unmeasured branch is where a silent regression lives.
#      Named residual, not closed here: on the default path :609's CANNOT CLASSIFY line is

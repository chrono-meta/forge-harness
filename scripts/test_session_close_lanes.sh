# test_session_close_lanes.sh — known-pair anchor for session_close_check.sh ② (harvest-loop
# obligation) and ⑤ (card-last invariant).
#
# WHY (2026-07-28): ② used to be an UNSATISFIABLE warning — it fired whenever an FH asset was
# touched today and the script had no way to observe whether harvest-loop ran, so no session could
# ever discharge it. A line that fires on every healthy close is noise, and noise trains the runner
# to skim past the ❌ lines that matter. The repair gave it a mechanical discharge (a harvest-loop
# decision recorded in TODAY's fh_completed file). This file is that repair's regression anchor:
# the fix is only real if the ⚠️ still fires when NOTHING is recorded, and stops firing when it is.
#
# Lanes (each is a decision the gate must get right, not a smoke test):
#   ②-N   FH asset touched today, no harvest-loop line anywhere  → ⚠️  MUST fire
#   ②-P1  same, plus "harvest-loop 실행 완료"                     → ✅  must NOT fire
#   ②-P2  same, plus an explicit SKIP note                        → ✅  must NOT fire
#         (CLAUDE.md ② accepts "harvest-loop (or an explicit skip note)" — a recorded skip is
#          a discharged obligation, not an evaded one)
#   ②-C   no FH asset touched today                               → neither line appears at all
#         (over-firing is a defect in its own right — the whole reason this repair exists)
#   ⑤-N   a close artifact newer than the card                    → ❌ card-last MUST fire (exit 1)
#   ⑤-P   card is the newest artifact                             → ✅ card-last holds
#   ⑤-T   card and artifact share an EXACT mtime                  → ⚠️  tie surfaced as advisory, exit 0
#
# Exit 0 = 8/8 lanes calibrated · exit 1 = the gate's instrument is wrong (do not trust its verdict)
# exit 3 = FIXTURE ERROR — a lane's premise never obtained, so this run's verdicts prove nothing

# on exactly the setup it is written for, and stayed green in CI where the variable is unset —
# environment dependence in the inverse of the usual direction, which is why it survived.
# The leak: ⑤-C reads the prior card from that store, so an unguarded lane compared its FIXTURE
# card against the operator's REAL companion history and reported a carry-over loss that belongs
# to neither. Measured A/B: exported → rc 1, 2 failures · unset → rc 0, 0 failures.
# Default it to a path that cannot exist; the three lanes that genuinely exercise ⑤-C set their

# ⑤ card-last fixture premise — the two ⑤ lanes are ORDERING lanes: each asserts what the subject
# does when one file is strictly newer than another. Establishing that ordering by writing one file
# after the other is not establishing it — it is hoping for it.
#
# WHY (2026-08-02, measured): ⑤-N flaked in CI — same headSha 41743c0, 36s apart, run 30732624697
# success / 30732642673 failure ("expected exit 1, got 0"), while the same commit passed locally.
# Two consecutive writes land 1.435–2.773ms apart (measured here, macOS/APFS).
#
# MECHANISM — MEASURED 2026-08-02, run 30734832234 (this file's own probe, below):
#     Linux  (ubuntu-latest, CI): 187/200 consecutive write-pairs INDISTINGUISHABLE to find -newer
#     Darwin (APFS, this laptop):   0/200
# The runner's mtime granularity is coarser than the gap between two back-to-back writes, so both
# files receive the same stamp, `find -newer` returns nothing, ⑤ correctly reports no violation, and
# the old lane read that as "the gate is broken". Confirmed with a known-positive control in the same
# run. It was carried as an explicit hypothesis until this number existed — the earlier text said so,
# and the declared source still does (fh_signal_2026-08-02_fh-direct.md §S2).
#
# READ THE NUMBER NARROWLY: the probe measures the TIGHTEST possible gap (two writes in one loop
# iteration). The fixture that actually flaked had a wider gap, so 187/200 establishes that the
# mechanism is real on this runner — NOT that the old lane failed 93.5% of the time. Same SHA
# flipping verdict 36s apart is consistent with that gap sitting near a tick boundary (inference,
# not measurement).
#
# Independent of the mechanism: the lane could not distinguish "no violation detected" from "no
# violation state created", so its verdict was unsafe whatever the cause. The repair below does not
# depend on the mechanism, which is why it shipped before the number arrived.
#
# Two repairs, both required:
#   (a) DETERMINISTIC separation — stamp the older file with an absolute past time via `touch -t`
#       (portable across BSD/GNU) instead of relying on write order inside one clock tick.
#   (b) an IN-RUN PREMISE CONTROL — before trusting either verdict, assert with the same `find -newer`
#       primitive the subject uses (NOT its exact glob/scope — the subject sweeps two filename
#       patterns across the directory, this checks one literal basename; the control validates
#       fixture STATE, not the subject's query) that the ordering actually holds, and print the
#       measured mtimes. An absence measurement without a control is how (a)'s absence went unnoticed
#       for a whole day: "no violation reported" and "no violation state created" are different facts
#       and the old lane could not tell them apart.
#
# A premise that does not obtain is a FIXTURE ERROR and exits **3** — not 1, and deliberately not 2
# (bash returns 2 for a script SYNTAX ERROR; squatting on it would make a rotted anchor announce
# itself as a benign fixture issue and send the reader hunting mtimes instead of reading the parse
# error — the same triage misdirection this file exists to remove). The first draft of this
# repair printed a distinct message and then folded it into the same `FAILED` flag as a real verdict
# mismatch — i.e. it reproduced, one layer up, the exact defect it was fixing: the two states were
# distinguishable in the log and identical at the interface CI actually gates on (the exit code / red
# X). Someone triaging from the run summary would land back in the ambiguity this file exists to
# remove. Caught by an isolated Wave-1 challenger, 2026-08-02.

# MECHANISM MEASUREMENT (diagnostic — always prints, never a verdict, never sets FAILED).
# The repair above makes the lanes deterministic regardless of why the old ones flaked, which is
# correct but leaves the original question open: did ubuntu-latest ever actually hand two
# back-to-back writes the SAME mtime? The repaired lanes cannot answer it — they stamp the files
# explicitly, so they measure the fixture, not the platform. This reproduces the OLD two-write shape
# in a loop and counts how often `find -newer` (the subject's own instrument) sees no separation.
# It costs one loop and settles a hypothesis the code otherwise has to keep labelling UNMEASURED.
# Reading it: ties=0 on the runner where the flake happened refutes the coarse-granularity story and
# the real cause is still open; ties>0 confirms it. Either way the number is the point, not a pass.
#
# The probe carries its own CONTROL, because its failure direction is the confirming one:
# "both find calls returned nothing" is what a TIE looks like — and also what a BROKEN find looks
# like (missing dir, failed mktemp, permission error; stderr is discarded). Without a control, any
# breakage of the instrument would print a large tie count and read as confirmation of the very
# hypothesis it was built to test. So a known-POSITIVE pair (deterministically separated by
# `touch -t`) is measured on the same instrument, before and after the loop. Control failure →
# the count is withheld and the probe reports UNCALIBRATED. A number is never printed without it.

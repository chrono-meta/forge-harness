#
# 🟥 EVERY LANE BUILDS A REAL, THROWAWAY GIT REPO UNDER mktemp AND RUNS THE CHECKER THERE.
# Not one lane scans this repository. That is not tidiness — a fixture that reads the live tree
# measures whatever the tree happens to look like today, so the lane's verdict drifts with
# unrelated commits and the known-pair stops being known ([[feedback_audit_target_must_be_frozen]]).
# It also means the lanes exercise the REAL git path (merge-base, --diff-filter=A) instead of an
# injected file list, so there is no test-only seam that production does not take.
#
# ── HOW THE KNOWN-POSITIVES WERE CHOSEN ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The trivial positive (a new script no lane mentions at all) is included, but it is NOT the
# load-bearing one — any name-grep would catch it. The lanes that decide whether this gate is real
# are P2–P5: the file IS named in a lane suite, in each of the four spellings that satisfy a name
# grep while executing zero lines of the subject. Those are the "뚫리는 표기"
# ([[feedback_fixture_must_use_the_breaking_spelling]]): if the fixture only used the easiest
# positive, a checker that greps for the name would score 100% here and ship as a decoration.
#   P2 comment · P3 grep pattern · P4 `bash -n` (syntax check) · P5 echoed string
#   P8 assigned to a variable, then only syntax-checked through it (added after N8's false positive)
# P4 is the sharpest: this repo has measured that `bash -n` passes a runtime bad-substitution that
# leaves a hook fail-open, so scoring it as coverage would certify the very instrument FH already
# ruled is not one ([[feedback_gate_verification_must_execute]]).
#
# Exit: 0 = every pair held · 1 = a pair collapsed · 10 = the harness could not set itself up.

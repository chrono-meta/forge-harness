# The lane this suite exists to prevent: on 2026-08-06 a 1.4.88 → 1.4.89 bump edited the FIRST
# marketplace plugin entry and left the SECOND at the old version. `test_tag_version_lanes.sh`
# reported 8/8 PASS through it — that lane compares the git tag to package.json and never opens
# marketplace.json. The drift was caught by an ad-hoc `sort | uniq -c`. Luck is not a floor.
#
# Every lane runs against a THROWAWAY fixture tree, never against this repo, so the suite is
# hermetic: a real bump in progress can neither turn it green nor turn it red.

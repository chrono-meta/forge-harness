# HOLE: the session-close block inserted at the TOP of templates/.git-hooks/pre-push starts a
# subprocess. git delivers the pushed ref list on the hook's STDIN, and the ref-reading loop runs
# AFTER that block. A stdin-inheriting subprocess drains the ref list → the loop sees zero refs →
# every DEL_/FORCED_ variable stays empty → the hook takes "nothing destructive → exit 0",
# silently disarming the Destructive-Op gate on a branch-delete / force push.
#
# This test reproduces the mechanism (not just greps for the fix), then asserts the fix is present.

#  self-inverted. Instrument defect caught by the instrument.)

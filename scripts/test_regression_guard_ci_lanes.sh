# test_regression_guard_ci_lanes.sh — regression fixtures for Axis 1's CI path.
#
# WHY (measured 2026-08-17, and this is a production fail-open that ran silently):
# `Axis 1 — Backward Regression Check` reported a GREEN check on every PR it triggered on, while
# never once comparing anything. Two independent faults, both required:
#   ① templates/regression_guard.sh --pr took a bare BRANCH NAME and ran `git merge-base main
#      <branch>`. In a GitHub Actions PR checkout neither name resolves — actions/checkout lands
#      on a DETACHED HEAD and creates refs/remotes/origin/*, not local branches. `fetch-depth: 0`
#      was already set and is NOT the cause: the history was there, the NAMES were not. → exit 3.
#   ② the workflow's Evaluate step was `2 -> block · 1 -> warn · else -> "PASS"`, so exit 3
#      ("could not run") fell into `else` and printed a green PASS.
# Sample: 5 of 5 runs inspected (4 historical + the one that surfaced it) hit ① and rendered ②.
# Scope stated honestly: 5/5 SAMPLED, not an exhaustive audit of every run ever.
#
# ② is the load-bearing half. Fixing ① alone leaves the next instrument error just as green,
# because `else` swallows every code nobody enumerated.
#
# These lanes assert BOTH directions, and include a REVERT PROBE: the fail-closed branch is
# neutralized and the suite must go red at exactly that lane — an anchor nobody has watched fail
# is an anchor nobody knows is alive.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_regression_guard_ci_lanes.sh   Exit: 0 = all behave; 1 = regression.

  # `main`. The old resolver guessed `main -> origin/main` and compared the base repo to itself.
  # (An earlier fixture used `rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`, which returns the literal string
  # "HEAD" on a detached checkout — a ref that DOES resolve, so the lane asserted nothing. Caught
  # by reproducing the CI shape locally rather than trusting the developer-machine green.)
  BR=main
  # Take every SHA from INSIDE the clone. A SHA read from the source repo is not guaranteed to
  # exist in the clone: when the source is a detached checkout with no local branches (which is
  # exactly what actions/checkout leaves), `git clone` has few refs to transfer from, so an
  # arbitrary source SHA may simply be absent. Reading from the clone removes that assumption
  # instead of hoping it holds — the previous version of this lane hoped, and CI disagreed.

  # 🟥 The BASE side must be a SHA too, and this cost a red CI to learn.
  # The first version passed `origin/main` as the base. That resolves on a developer machine and
  # NOT in CI: a GitHub Actions checkout is detached with no local `main`, so a clone of it has no
  # `origin/main` either. Consequences, both measured on the same run:
  #   L8b failed  — base unresolvable, so the SHA lane could never reach its assertion
  #   L8a "passed" FOR THE WRONG REASON — it expects exit 3, and got exit 3 from the BASE failing,
  #                 not from the head NAME being refused. A green lane measuring something else.
  # This file's own header warns that asserting only BLOCK cannot tell "blocked" from "blocked for
  # the wrong reason". Holding exactly one variable is the fix: base is always a resolvable SHA,
  # so any refusal is attributable to the head, and the assertion checks the head half by name.
  # 🟥 `git rev-parse HEAD~1` prints the literal string "HEAD~1" ON STDOUT when it fails, so
  # `$(... || fallback)` captures that string alongside the fallback. Measured in CI: the clone of
  # a detached, branchless checkout has a single reachable commit, HEAD~1 does not exist, and
  # BASE_SHA became the literal "HEAD~1" — which then failed to resolve and turned this lane red
  # for a reason unrelated to what it tests. Same family as `|| echo 0` emitting "0\n0".

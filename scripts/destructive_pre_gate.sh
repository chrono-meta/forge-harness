# destructive_pre_gate.sh — PreToolUse(Bash) advisory: a destructive command about to run.
#
# THE DEFECT
#   A session under ship pressure self-justifies a destructive git/rm command and runs it in the
#   same breath ("contents are identical, so reset --hard is safe"). Observed 2026-08-01 on a
#   below-floor sidecar (GLM 4-bit): self-justification THEN `git reset --hard origin/main` — the
#   weaker the tier, the weaker the self-inhibition, so the counterweight must be mechanical, not
#   prose. Origin prototype: pmh-dev scripts/destructive_pre_gate.sh (field→meta reverse
#   propagation, hardened here to the pipe_verdict_guard pattern).
#
# ROLE DECONFLICTION (no double-gate)
#   templates/.git-hooks/pre-push already HARD-BLOCKS the git-side irreversible surface at push
#   time (force/non-ff push, remote branch delete — DESTRUCTIVE_OP_OK channel). This guard is the
#   shift-left SALIENCE layer at the Bash-call surface, and its net-new coverage is the LOCAL
#   destructive ops no hook currently sees: reset --hard, clean -f, checkout ., stash drop/clear,
#   rm -rf on root/home/cwd. For force-push it fires earlier than pre-push but never replaces it.
#
# DEGRADE DIRECTION: advisory. Warns and exits 0 — a false block on a developer's shell trains
#   the --no-verify reflex on the hooks that DO guard irreversible surfaces. Set
#   FH_DESTRUCTIVE_BLOCK=1 to escalate to exit 2 (stderr → model, call blocked).
#   EXCEPTION (2026-11-03): with FH_DESTRUCTIVE_BLOCK unset and the hook payload's
#   permission_mode = bypassPermissions, it blocks by default — nobody reads an advisory before a
#   bypass-mode call runs. FH_DESTRUCTIVE_BLOCK=0 restores advisory there. Other modes unchanged.
#   Unparseable/absent payload → silent exit 0 (an unparsed input is not a finding; block mode
#   fails open on a dead python3 — same accepted residual as pipe_verdict_guard, the surface is
#   the reversible Bash call, not the irreversible act itself).
#
# PRECISION OVER RECALL (named residuals, deliberate — the full list, per the Axis-2 pass 2026-08-01)
#   NOT flagged, by decision or by construction:
#   - `rm -rf <absolute path>` other than /, ~, . — scratchpad/build cleanup lives there and 100%
#     FP trains dismissal of the one hit that matters (pipe_verdict S5 lesson).
#   - `git rebase` — reflog-recoverable, and interactive rebase is unsupported here anyway.
#   - Env-var / eval indirection (`rm -rf $HOME`, `OPT=--hard; git reset $OPT`), `find -delete`,
#     `xargs rm -rf`, shell aliases — unreachable by a regex over the literal command by
#     construction; a parser would be over-build for an advisory layer. Registered, not closed.
#   - Mention-as-data FP: heredoc bodies, `echo "git reset --hard"`, `git log -S '…'` DO fire —
#     the flatten step cannot tell code from quoted data (measured live: the guard fired on the
#     Axis-2 reviewer's own probe command). Advisory-tolerated; use `# noqa: destructive-op` when
#     editing/documenting this guard itself.
#   - Two JSON-emitting hooks on one matcher (this + pipe_verdict_guard): per the hook docs each
#     hook's stdout is parsed independently; simultaneous-fire not runtime-verified (LOW).
#   - noqa smuggling: the opt-out is checked against the WHOLE command, so a multi-statement
#     payload with a destructive line 1 and a `# noqa: destructive-op` on line 2 exempts both.
#     Accepted: noqa is self-grantable by design on this advisory surface (same trust channel as
#     the DESTRUCTIVE_OP_OK env ack) — the hard floor for the irreversible half stays pre-push.
#   - `git -c alias.<name>='!<shell>' <name>` — the normalizer CONSUMES `-c k=v` (it must: that is
#     how `git -c core.x=y reset --hard` is caught), and the alias name that follows is not a
#     destructive row, so arbitrary shell runs CLEAN. Concrete realization of the indirection class
#     above, named separately because the normalizer is what makes it reachable (terra round 2,
#     2026-08-01). Not fixed: closing it means interpreting alias payloads, i.e. parsing shell —
#     over-build for an advisory layer, and squarely inside the deliberate-obfuscation threat model
#     this guard excludes. It counters SELF-JUSTIFICATION, not evasion.
#   - Shell-escape reconstruction (`\g\i\t reset --hard`, `$'git' reset`) and quoted-space git -C
#     paths (`git -C "/tmp/my repo" reset --hard`) — regex-with-normalization cannot dequote like
#     a shell; a Bash-compatible tokenizer would be over-build for an advisory layer (GPT-round,
#     registered). Deliberate-obfuscation is outside this guard's threat model anyway: it counters
#     SELF-JUSTIFICATION, not adversarial evasion.
#   - Block mode (FH_DESTRUCTIVE_BLOCK=1) is an ESCALATED ADVISORY, not an enforcement boundary:
#     malformed payload / dead python3 / grep processing failure all fail open by the documented
#     degrade direction (reversible surface). A project needing a hard floor on these ops wires a
#     PreToolUse permission rule or server-side protection, not this guard (GPT-round, pinned by
#     the fault-injection lanes).
#
# DELIVERY CHANNEL: advisory emits JSON on stdout — hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext (model)
#   + systemMessage (user). permissionDecision DELIBERATELY ABSENT: the guard must never
#   auto-approve what it exists to question (PR#217 contract, memory
#   feedback_advisory_invisible_to_actor).
#
# Usage:
#   hook:  PreToolUse matcher "Bash" → bash scripts/destructive_pre_gate.sh
#   test:  printf '%s' "<command>" | bash scripts/destructive_pre_gate.sh --stdin-raw
# Opt out with `# noqa: destructive-op` — exempts the ENTIRE Bash payload (whole-command match,
# see PRECISION OVER RECALL above), not a single line.

#   tabs → spaces, squeezed   → `git  reset --hard` (double space) matches (A2)
# Anchoring: rows require a leading separator `[ (/]` before the command word (NOT command-position
# anchoring — sudo/env/xargs wrappers keep a space before the word and stay caught). This closes the

# TAIL (fired live twice on this guard's own review commands, 2026-08-01). Full command-position
# anchoring stays REJECTED (would drop sudo/env wrappers); `/` in the class keeps `/bin/rm` caught.
# GPT-round (R4) semantics fixes, each lane-pinned:
#   backslash-newline joins with EMPTY string, matching shell semantics — a space here let
#   `git re\` + newline + `set --hard` split the token and miss (measured bypass).
#   Separators `&& || | & ( )` are space-padded so `:&&git reset --hard` and `--force|cat`
#   satisfy the leading/trailing boundary classes without whitespace in the original.

# Why this file exists at all: until 2026-08-13 the checker that detects unrun lane suites had
# **no lane suite of its own**. It guarded its own WIRING (it fails if selfcheck.sh stops calling
# it) but nothing measured its BEHAVIOUR. That is the same shape it exists to catch, one level up —
# a check whose verdicts nobody exercises is prose with an exit code.
#
# The lanes below drive it against SYNTHETIC fixture trees, not against this repo. Driving it
# against the live tree would make every lane depend on today's suite list, so a lane would go red
# for reasons that have nothing to do with the predicate under test.
#
# Script-relative, NOT `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`: in a vendored tree rev-parse returns the
# OUTER repo and this suite would then test someone else's checkout.

# `.git` up-chain walk, `git ls-files -z`, a python3 subprocess) and is not guaranteed to answer
# identically twice in a row under CI resource pressure — so a call site combining `$(run "$D")`
# with a SEPARATE `$(rcof "$D")` could silently pair stdout from one run with the exit code of a
# DIFFERENT run. That produced an impossible-looking CI flake: rc=0 with the literal substring
# "declared debt" absent from $out, even though every rc=0 exit path in lane_runner_check.sh
# unconditionally prints that substring (traced exhaustively — see
# tracks/_meta/armC_armC-wt2_report2_2026-09-03.md). Sets LRC_OUT/LRC_RC as globals: this file is

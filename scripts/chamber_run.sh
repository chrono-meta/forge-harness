#!/usr/bin/env bash
# chamber_run.sh — chamber run orchestrator (the runner the skeleton's gaps G1-forcing/G2/G4/STATUS all
# hung on). GLUE ONLY: it wires the pieces that already exist (workspace convention · budget gate notion ·
# the isolated persona agents · the Emission Gate · the G4 ledger) into one intent-driven, resumable flow
# so a chamber run can be *completed by intent* rather than hand-followed from the skeleton doc.
#
# What it MECHANIZES: workspace + INTENT/BUDGET templates · STATUS stamping (resumable — re-run to advance) ·
# the budget-entry gate (G2: blocks step 4 until an ESTIMATE is recorded — no uncapped run) · the step-4
# isolation gate (G1-forcing: blocks step 5 until SIM_NOTES has ≥3 blind persona sections) · the Emission
# Gate verdict capture · actual-cost record · and the G4 ledger auto-append (idempotent).
#
# What it CANNOT mechanize (honest muscle boundary, documented in CHAMBER_RUN_SKELETON.md): bash cannot
# spawn the isolated Agents itself. Step 4 PRINTS the exact dispatch and GATES on the ≥3 persona artifact —
# the human/Claude does the actual `fh-meta:{beginner,challenger,main-player}` dispatch. Isolation stays a
# salience+artifact gate, not a spawn. Budget/cost numbers calibrate only across real runs (muscle, not wiring).
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/chamber_run.sh <candidate-slug>          # create/advance the run (idempotent)
#         bash scripts/chamber_run.sh <candidate-slug> status    # show where the run is
#   exit 0 = advanced or already complete · exit 1 = blocked on a missing artifact (message says which)
#   exit 2 = harness error (FH root / bad slug)

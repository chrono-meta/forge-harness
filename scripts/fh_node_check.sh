# fh_node_check.sh — per-NODE environment floor check, fired at SessionStart.
#
# WHY A NODE-SCOPED CHECK EXISTS:
#   A user's context (companion store, memory, session card) travels between machines; the machine's
#   own wiring does not. A rich context makes an unwired laptop read as "already configured".
#   Measured 2026-07-30: a machine holding the full companion store and memory ran sessions with its
#   SessionStart hooks unregistered; nothing surfaced it — it was found by accident.
#
# WHY IT IS NOT INSIDE fh_session_load.sh:
#   That script is registered in the gitignored .claude/settings.local.json, so on a fresh clone it
#   is not registered — the situation this check exists for is the one in which it could not run.
#   This script carries no operator-private path, so it can be registered from
#   templates/settings.SessionStart.snippet.json, which IS tracked and ships with a clone.
#   HONEST SCOPE: registration still requires the wizard to merge that snippet — every
#   .claude/settings*.json path in this repo is gitignored, so no SessionStart entry can be tracked.
#   The chicken-and-egg is REDUCED (script + snippet ship), not ELIMINATED (a user who never runs
#   the wizard still gets nothing). An earlier revision of this header claimed "survives a clone";
#   that was false, and a cross-family review caught it before merge. Do not restore the claim
#   without running `git check-ignore` on the settings paths first.
#
# EMISSION IS STATE-BASED, NOT EVENT-BASED — this is the load-bearing design decision:
#   A missing floor is a PERSISTENT CONDITION, so it is reported EVERY session until fixed.
#   A healthy machine is silent AFTER its one event line (first session / machine change / infra
#   delta) — events report once, conditions report until they stop being true.
#   Earlier revisions fired on events only (first session / machine change / idle >= 7 days / HEAD
#   advanced >= 20 commits) and that was wrong in both directions: on this hub's measured velocity
#   (~33 commits/week) the commit axis fired every ~4 days on a healthy machine (noise, and an
#   ignored detector cannot be revived), while a broken machine reported once then went quiet
#   forever — reproducing the very accident above.
#
# Detector, never a gate: always exits 0, and it RECOMMENDS — it cannot compel.
# State: tracks/_meta/.fh_node_state (gitignored; excluded from companion sync — it is machine-local
# by nature, and mirroring it would make node identity flap between machines).
# FH_NODE_STATE overrides the state path (used by the wizard's verification so that verifying does
# not consume a one-shot event report).

# a machine idle for two weeks sat 145 commits behind origin/main with zero signal from this hook

# WHY THE TARGET REF IS THE LOCAL main BRANCH, NOT `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD`: an earlier
# revision compared `HEAD..origin/<current-branch>`. Two bugs, one catch (fh-meta:challenger
# 2026-08-15 [HIGH]): (a) on a detached HEAD, `symbolic-ref` fails and silently fell back to the
# literal string "main" — not empty — so the "not measurable, stay silent" case never triggered
# and it happily compared against the wrong ref; (b) on a feature branch — this repo's own normal
# workflow (CLAUDE.md §PR Direction: never commit main directly) — it compared against
# origin/<feature-branch>, never origin/main, so the exact incident this check exists to catch
# (idle main sitting behind) would NOT have been caught while checked out on a feature branch.
# Fix: always measure the LOCAL main branch REF directly (refs/heads/<default>), independent of
# what is currently checked out. Default branch name is read from origin/HEAD, falling back to
# "main" only if that symref is absent (e.g. never fetched before).

# finding_fleet.sh — run a parallel, multi-family review fleet over one file and emit TYPED findings.
#
# WHY. FH's review output has always been prose, so nothing downstream could count it, filter it, or
# hand it to a second opinion. Measured 2026-09-08 over eight GHSA cases x3: FH made 52 claims with 5
# wrong about the code (9.6%); a sibling harness made 73 -- 40% more -- with 2 wrong (2.7%). The gap
# was not reading quality. That harness emits findings as typed records, has a different family stamp
# each one, and deletes the false positives with a filter. This script is the first half of that shape
# for FH: fan out to several families in parallel, each returning JSONL. The second half, the reject
# stage, is scripts/finding_verify.py, and it refuses to let a family verify its own findings.
#
# WHAT IS MECHANIZED: that each finding carries the family and role that produced it, that the members
# run in parallel and independently, and that a member which fails is recorded as failed rather than
# quietly contributing nothing. WHAT IS NOT: what counts as a defect. No rule about findings lives here.
#
# FLEET TABLE. One member per line, `family|role|command`. The command receives the review prompt BOTH
# on stdin and as a file whose path replaces the token PROMPT_FILE in the command — some CLIs take the
# prompt as an argument and their -p flag is variadic, so piping it silently turns the next flag into
# the prompt (measured 2026-09-08: `agy -p --model X` sent "--model" as the prompt and reported it).
# Must print JSONL findings on stdout. Override with --fleet <file>; the default is two external
# families so that neither is the Claude governor calling this script.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/finding_fleet.sh <target-file> --out <dir> [--fleet <table>] [--roles-only]
#         bash scripts/finding_fleet.sh --selftest
# Exit:   0 = at least one member returned findings · 1 = all members failed (nothing was reviewed)
#         2 = usage error

PROMPT_HEAD='You are one reviewer in a parallel fleet. Review the file below for defects in your assigned area.

Output ONLY JSON Lines, one object per finding, nothing else — no prose, no code fences:
{"title":"<short claim>","file":"<name>","line":<int>,"severity":"S|A|B","category":"<one word>","detail":"<what goes wrong and when>","defeater":"<what would be OBSERVED if this claim were wrong>","confidence":<0.0-1.0>}

S = exploitable or fail-open. A = real but non-blocking. B = minor.
`defeater` is required and must name something observable — a value, an output, a code path that
would be reached — not "if I misread it". A claim whose own falsification condition cannot be stated
is a claim you are not yet entitled to make.
Report only defects you can point to a specific line for. If you find none, output nothing.

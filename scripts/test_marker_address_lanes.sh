# test_marker_address_lanes.sh — fixtures for pre-commit's `unread_markers`.
#
# WHAT IT GUARDS. The Axes 2+3 gate reads exactly ONE file:
# `.axes_23_passed_<BRANCH_SLUG>_<TODAY>.marker`. A marker written under any other name is a valid
# RECORD and gets ZERO validation — yet its author believes "I wrote a marker" means "the evidence
# was checked". Measured 2026-08-30: one session wrote **8** markers at addresses the hook never
# reads; all 8 carried `floor-status: opus-tier`, which is not in the enum, and nothing caught it.
# The moment the name matched, the gate rejected two format errors in two attempts.
# This is [[feedback_half_externalization_slot_without_consumer]] applied to the gate's own evidence.
#
# 🟥 SCOPE — channel, never conclusion. The advisory asks "is your evidence at the address the
# reader uses", never "is that marker any good". It must NEVER block: writing extra records under
# descriptive names is legitimate practice, and blocking it would push authors toward writing
# fewer records, which is the opposite of the goal. L4 pins the non-blocking property.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_marker_address_lanes.sh   Exit: 0 = all behave; 1 = regression.

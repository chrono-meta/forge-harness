# test_degrade_scan_shell_probes.sh — regression anchor for the shell (S*) probes of
# scripts/degrade_direction_scan.sh.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (measured 2026-07-28, known-pair calibration):
#   The scan COLLECTED `.sh` files but every probe was Python-shaped (`except:` / `.get(k, True)` /
#   `if not x:` / `.split()`). A known-positive bash file carrying four distinct default-toward-PASS
#   shapes scored 0/4 and the scan printed "no default-toward-PASS smells in 1 scanned py/sh file".
#   That is a FALSE CLEAN — strictly worse than honest non-coverage, because a caller keying on the
#   message or exit code reads it as verified.
#   A second, larger hole surfaced in the same run: git hooks are named `pre-push` / `pre-commit`
#   (no extension) and live under a DOTTED directory, so `templates/.git-hooks` — FH's own mechanical
#   floor — reported "no scannable (py/sh) target files", exit 0.
#
# The assertions below pin: (1) the S-probes separate a known pair, (2) extensionless shell files
# under a dotted directory are collected, (3) the Python probes did not regress, and (4) two
# deliberate NON-detections stay non-detections — flagging them would push an author to delete a
# remedy or to silence a legitimate precondition guard.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/test_degrade_scan_shell_probes.sh
# Exit:   0 = all assertions pass; 1 = a regression.

# carries the Destructive-Op gate, so a trained bypass disarms an irreversible-surface gate too.
# BEHAVIOURAL, not shape: it asserts the OUTPUT is confined to the named file, which is the property
# the hook relies on. A grep for "does the hook pass an argument" would pass on a scanner that
# accepts arguments and ignores them.

# session_close_check.sh — mechanical checklist for the session close chain (CLAUDE.md §Session Wrap-up ①–⑥).
#
# WHY (loop_engineering.md census, 2026-07-10): the close chain's complete/persist legs were PROSE —
# card-last ordering and step coverage lived on salience alone, and the measured misses (card
# staleness class) all landed on exactly these legs. This script is the MECH floor: it VERIFIES
# state, it does not perform the steps (the session still runs them; the script catches skips).
# Built on operator instruction 2026-07-10 (strengthen-the-weak pass; evidence-threshold override
# recorded — the miss class was already measured, only the build trigger was overridden).
#
# READ-ONLY. Exit 0 = close state consistent · exit 1 = a close invariant is violated (card-last
# broken, or a required artifact missing). Advisory lines are prefixed ⚠️ , violations ❌ .
#
# Usage: bash scripts/session_close_check.sh [repo_root]   (run at close time, before ⑥ push)

  # Anchored by scripts/test_session_close_chain_lanes.sh lane ①-b-P3.
  # 🟥 `--author "@me"` ALONE counted ZERO for every cloud-session PR. Those are authored by the
  # GitHub App `app/claude`, not by the local user (`chrono-meta`), so the sweep reported 0 while
  # cloud PRs were open and a close passed silently as "no open PRs" — the same class of silence
  # the occurrence-count fix above was written to end, one layer up. Measured 2026-09-21 with a
  # known pair on MERGED PRs (the open set was empty, so the 0-case could not calibrate it):

  # been blind for a long time, not just on the day it was noticed.

# ── ①-c LIVE PEER SESSIONS in this same harness ─────────────────────────────────
# WHY: FH's close chain has an agreed two-axis order (peer appends → ping → **ask "더 있나" before
# folding** → fold → re-check merged PRs), and it lived only in the session card as prose. Measured
# 2026-08-09, the first two-axis close: the ping surfaced four deltas the closing session did not
# know about, and **two of them were structurally invisible to `gh pr list`** (an inheritance
# channel and a landing check — no PR exists for either). So a PR sweep is not a substitute; the
# question is. This block does the DETECTION half mechanically. It never merges anything and never
# blocks — the merge is where the loss risk is (two sessions writing one card is the shared-checkout
# hazard this repo already named), and one occurrence is below this repo's own mechanization bar.
#
# HOW: a live session owns /tmp/cc-socks/<pid>.sock. pid → cwd resolves the ONE thing that actually
# matters, "is this peer in MY harness" — which the agent-facing session list cannot answer, because
# it reports names, not directories. Stale sockets are detectable (pid gone), so absence here is a
# measurement rather than silence.
# SCOPE (operator, 2026-08-09): this is a **claude-agents / Agent-View** feature — the surface where
# sessions are deliberately run in parallel. A plain solo terminal must not be nagged because some
# other window happens to be open. Discriminator is env, set by the parent that spawns the session.
#   ⚠️ NEGATIVE ARM UNVERIFIED: a child session cannot observe a top-level session's environment, so
#   "a real top-level session lacks these vars" is asserted, not measured. The lane simulates absence
#   by unsetting them, which tests THIS SCRIPT'S logic — not that claim. Verify from a plain terminal.

# ④-e DISPATCH-LOG RECONCILIATION — mechanical, because prose failed completely.
# CLAUDE.md makes an invocation-log entry MANDATORY immediately after any custom sub-agent
# invocation (it feeds the 60/40 promotion gate and the UAP loop). Measured 2026-08-02: a single
# session dispatched 20+ subagents and logged ZERO — not a marginal lapse, a total one, in the same
# session that RECOVERED that very log file from a branch about to be deleted. An obligation that
# loses 20 times out of 20 is not under-emphasised; it is unmechanized. Per this repo's own rule
# (1-2 occurrences -> prose; N>=3 or a repeat on another surface -> mechanize), this is well past it.
#
# The check is a RECONCILIATION, not an auto-writer. A hook cannot fill `outcome` or `evidence`
# without fabricating judgment, and a fabricated log entry is worse than a missing one — it would
# poison the promotion gate with invented outcomes. So the hook only TALLIES (SubagentStop appends a
# date line) and this step compares the tally against today's entries.
#
# It deliberately does NOT demand 1:1. Consolidating twenty challenger rounds into one entry with
# measured counts is better bookkeeping than twenty stubs, and punishing it would train stub-spam.
# What it catches is the failure that actually happened: dispatches occurred and NOTHING was written.
# ABSENCE IS NOT ZERO. The tally comes from a SubagentStop hook configured in `.claude/settings.json`,
# which is GITIGNORED by design (it also carries local permissions). So a fresh clone, another
# machine, or a wiped settings file has no hook — and without this branch the check would read an
# empty tally as "no dispatches today" and pass in silence. That is the exact fail-open this whole
# step exists to close, re-created inside it; caught before commit by asking where the tally comes
# from. Installable snippet: templates/subagent-tally-hook.json.

  # days ago. Two artifacts tied with an old card then fall outside the window and ⑤ reports

# The failure mode is what makes it serious: grep writes that to stderr, exits 2, and emits NOTHING.
# Downstream this is indistinguishable from exit 1 "no match", so the pipeline produced zero lines
# and the probe concluded "no absence claims in the card" — CLEAN — on every input, positive and
# negative alike. Its 7 lanes had passed 3/3 on macOS for weeks because BSD grep accepts the range.
# Same shape as the pyyaml CI trigger caught earlier the same day: grep's ERROR status folded into

# ⑤-C CARRY-OVER probe — 카드 재작성이 «아직 안 온 기한» 을 날렸는가.
# WHY (2026-08-24, 실측 손실 1건): ⑤ 재작성이 delta update 가 아니라 새로 쓰기가 되어 미완·
# 시각박힌 항목이 통째로 사라졌다 — 그날 저녁 19:00 게시, 다음날 GeekNews, 14일 referrer 측정,
# 08-26 미팅. 세션은 "BEFORE 172 → AFTER 101" 이라는 diff 를 출력하고도 «줄었다» 만 말하고
# «무엇이 빠졌나» 는 보지 않았다. 운영자가 물어서 발견 — 자력 아니다.
# 🟥 이것은 tier 문제가 아니라 WIRING 문제다. 카드 규율(§Session Wrap-up)은 「완료 항목이
# 남는 게 버그」라고 한 방향만 적고 있고, 그 역방향(미완이 사라지는 것)은 검사가 0줄이었다.
# 규율이 한 방향만 적혀 있으면 그 반대는 안 보인다. base op 이 살리언스에만 얹혀 있었으므로
# sonnet_floor_doctrine §tier-gated base op = defect 에 해당한다 — N 을 세기 전에 닫는다.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS (채널이지 결론이 아니다 — CLAUDE.md §Mechanization Boundary):
#   「이전 카드에 있던 **미래 날짜**가 오늘 카드나 오늘 fh_completed 에 여전히 나타나는가」
#   = 기록의 성질(존재·귀속). 「이 항목을 지워도 되는가」는 **판정하지 않는다** — 그건 판단이고
#   얼리면 오늘의 판단이 내일의 천장이 된다. 완료 처리했으면 fh_completed 에 날짜가 남으므로
#   그 경로로 통과한다.
#
# HONEST SCOPE:
#   · 판별자는 `YYYY-MM-DD` / `MM-DD` 토큰뿐이다. 날짜 없이 적힌 미완(«4090 부팅 UNKNOWN»)은
#     구조적으로 못 잡는다 — 앵커지 floor 가 아니다.
#   · 이전 카드는 companion store 의 git 이력에서 온다. 그게 없는 install(대부분의 소비자)에서는
#     **SKIP 이고 PASS 가 아니다** — 미측정을 초록으로 접지 않는다.
#   · ASCII 클래스만 쓴다. 다국어 RANGE 를 bracket 안에 넣으면 C 로케일 GNU grep 이
#     `Invalid collation character` 로 exit 2 하고 **아무것도 안 뱉는다** → no-match 와 구분 불가
#     (⑤-b 가 2026-07-31 에 정확히 그렇게 무음 통과했다).
# DEGRADE: 이전 카드 못 구함 → SKIP(미측정 표기) · 구했는데 미래날짜 유실 → FAIL=1.
#   FAIL 은 FH_SESSION_CLOSE=1 인 close push 만 막고 일반 push 는 surface 한다(가역 표면 규율).
#   과차단 시 override: FH_CARRYOVER_OK=1 (무엇을 우회했는지 출력에 남는다).
# 기본값을 두지 않는다 — companion store 의 이름은 install 마다 다르고, 특정 이름을 공개
# 파일에 박으면 그 자체가 operator-private 토큰이다(이 줄은 실제로 그렇게 한 번 차단됐다).
# 설정은 각자의 로컬 바인딩에서 FH_COMPANION_STORE 로 준다.

# ── ①-g STALE REF (advisory) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# WHY THIS IS HERE AND NOT AT COMMIT TIME. `scripts/stale_ref_scan.py` (#770) exists because the
# three sibling instruments — halffix_propagation_scan · claim_propagation_scan · doc_claim_triad_scan
# — all presuppose that SOMEONE TOUCHED SOMETHING. An aging reference satisfies no such trigger:
# nobody edits a DOI on the day it stops being the latest version. #773 then shipped the tool with
# its own residual: «배선 안 함 — 이 계기는 지금 아무도 안 부른다». Measured 2026-09-21: its only
# call sites were its own lane suite and that suite's selfcheck wiring, BOTH `--offline-fixture`.
# So nothing had ever asked the question of the real corpus.
#
# 🟥 A commit-time trigger would rebuild the exact blind spot — it would fire only when someone
#    touches the file. A close-time sweep has no touch precondition, which is the whole point.
# 🟥 **advisory — it never blocks.** #773 states the corpus false-positive rate is UNMEASURED and
#    some stale citations are deliberate pins; blocking a reversible surface on an unmeasured
#    instrument trains `--no-verify` and disarms the Destructive-Op gate in the same hook
#    (CLAUDE.md §Surface-Class Degrade Invariant, reversible half).
# 🟥 **못 읽음 ≠ 깨끗함.** The scanner folds SUPERSEDED and UNRESOLVED into one rc (its own header
#    says so), so this block reads the VERDICT LINE's counters instead of the exit code — the #767
#    lesson about scanners reporting "could not read" as "clean" applies to the caller too.
# SCOPE: tracked files only, `tracks/**` excluded — those are past local records that must not be
# edited, and #770 measured most corpus hits landing there. Including them would be pure noise.

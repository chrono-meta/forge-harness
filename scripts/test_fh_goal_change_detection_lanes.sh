# Known-pair lane for fh-goal's change detection.
#
# 🟥 WHAT THIS EXISTS TO STOP (2026-08-26, cross-family/codex finding):
#   `git` present + a real repo does NOT mean `diff`/`status` SUCCEEDS. Before this lane,
#   a FAILING `git status` produced an empty TARGET_FILES, which the skip-branch could not
#   tell apart from "nothing changed" → `exit 0` → **fh-gate never ran, caller read it as a
#   clean run**. fh-goal.sh already named that exact class in a comment and had closed it for
#   the "no git at all" branch only.
#
# The pair:
#   ARM A (known-positive) git status FAILS         → MUST exit 10  ← red before the fix
#   ARM B (known-negative) git status OK, no output → MUST exit 0   (genuinely nothing changed)
#   ARM C (control)        git status OK, one file  → MUST reach fh-gate (proves A/B are not
#                                                     just "everything exits early")
# Without ARM C, A and B both pass on a script that never gets to the gate at all.

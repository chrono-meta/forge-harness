# fh_env_delta_scan.sh — Mode D SessionStart ENVIRONMENT-DELTA detector (mechanical).
#
# WHY: FH's "undeployed-asset discovery + auto-mapping" (CLAUDE.md claim ②) works ONLY when a skill
# is explicitly invoked. The AUTONOMOUS half — "the environment changed (a new sibling repo pulled,
# a task-first session opened in an unmapped project) → detect it and propose setup" — did NOT exist
# in code. It was suppressed by the onboarding guards (metadata-is-not-intent, task-first skip), which
# are correct (they stop FALSE onboarding from branch-name metadata) but also silence GENUINE
# env-change setup. (Measured miss 2026-07-06: pulling pmh in the company env was not self-detected.
# Cross-family confirmed 2026-07-06: Claude workflow + codex both rated ② PARTIAL/THEATER, biggest 허풍.)
#
# WHAT: this is the SIBLING of scripts/fh_session_load.sh. That hook closes the companion-store
# FRESHNESS gap ("did the store change?"); THIS hook closes the CAPABILITY-SURFACE gap ("did the
# environment change?"). It scans the projects root for git repos that are neither mapped
# (tracks/{name}/ — the is-mapped signal, feedback_tracks_dir_is_mapped_signal) nor wizard-done
# (~/.cc_sentinels/{name}_wizard_done), and emits a ONE-LINE proposal into turn-0 context. It fires
# BEFORE the first user turn regardless of what the user types — so it closes the task-first salience
# gap mechanically, exactly as fh_session_load.sh does for freshness.
#
# INVARIANTS:
#  - PROPOSE, never auto-act. Detection is mechanical; mapping/install stays approval-gated (HITL).
#    The hook emits a proposal line; the agent decides whether to surface/act. (metadata-is-not-intent:
#    a mechanical fs delta is a proposal input, not an executed mapping.)
#  - ONE-LINE proposal, NOT the onboarding menu. The guards suppress menus for a reason; this is a
#    targeted delta, not a door skeleton.
#  - Silent no-op when nothing is new (no repos, or all mapped/wizard-done). Majority path = quiet.
#  - Offline-safe / fast: pure local filesystem, no network, maxdepth-1 scan.
#  - Non-Mode-D public users: harmless — it only ever PROPOSES /install-wizard --dry-run, which is
#    itself read-only. Still, gate on the hub being present so a bare plugin install stays silent.

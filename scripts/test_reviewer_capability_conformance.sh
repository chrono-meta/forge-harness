#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test_reviewer_capability_conformance.sh — runs the SHARED corpus against THIS repo's
# reviewer-capability implementation and reports every disagreement.
#
# THE CONTRACT, and why it is shaped this way. Three repos judge "can this model be an
# adversarial reviewer?" in three languages (bash hook · shell probe · python backend).
#
# Be precise about WHY they do not share a library, because the first draft of this comment
# overstated it and a cross-family review caught the inversion: residency blocks the
# PRIVATE→PUBLIC direction (internal model ids must never reach a public repo). It does NOT
# stop a private repo from vendoring a sanitized PUBLIC library. The actual reasons are
# (a) three languages/runtimes, and (b) the classifier is two regexes — a shared library
# would add more coupling than the thing it shares. Residency governs the CORPUS's contents,
# not the decision to share data instead of code.
#
# What they share is `scripts/reviewer_capability_corpus.tsv`
# — pure data, residency-safe. Each side keeps its own implementation and vendors this
# script plus the corpus; drift then surfaces as a red test in whichever repo drifted,
# instead of as a silent difference nobody measures.
#
# Measured before this existed: 19 ids, 10 disagreements between two implementations, 9 of
# them the private side reading INCAPABLE as CAPABLE. That drift had shipped and was
# invisible — nothing compared the two.
#
# ── PORTING THIS TO ANOTHER REPO (the adapter is the only thing you write) ──────
# Copy this file + the corpus, then replace classify() with a call into your own code:
#   shell :  classify(){ your_probe.sh --check-model "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo CAPABLE || echo INCAPABLE; }
#   python:  classify(){ python3 -c 'import sys;from x import is_reviewer_capable;
#                        print("CAPABLE" if is_reviewer_capable(sys.argv[1]) else "INCAPABLE")' "$1"; }
# Everything else — corpus parsing, verdict comparison, the UNDECIDABLE rule — stays.
#
# ── THE UNDECIDABLE ROWS ARE THE POINT ─────────────────────────────────────────
# An implementation with only a denylist answers CAPABLE for an unrecognised id. That is
# fail-open: a denylist cannot know `voyage-3` is an embedding model. Such an implementation
# FAILS these rows, and that failure is correct — it is telling you to add a default-deny
# leg, not to edit the corpus. A repo that genuinely cannot express UNDECIDABLE may set
# ALLOW_UNDECIDABLE_AS_INCAPABLE=1, which is strictly-safer and reported as a named
# deviation rather than a silent pass.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_reviewer_capability_conformance.sh   Exit: 0 = conforms; 1 = drift.

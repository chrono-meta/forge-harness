# universal_guard_check.sh — known-pair anchor for the pre-commit UNIVERSAL guards.
#
# WHAT IT PINS (2026-07-26, N=5 of the gate-locality class):
#   The confidentiality/privacy guards in templates/.git-hooks/pre-commit are SURFACE-scoped
#   ("content is being committed to a public repo"), NOT 4-axis-scoped ("an FH asset changed").
#   They used to be authored below the `exit 0  # No FH assets staged` line, so their scope
#   silently inherited the 4-axis classifier's asset pathspec: a commit staging only non-asset
#   paths skipped the confidentiality scan entirely. Measured then: 46/241 tracked files (19.1%)
#   unscannable that way, 32 also outside npm files[] (no publish-time backstop either).
#   This anchor fails if that coupling is ever reintroduced.
#
#   It also pins the credential-SHAPE patterns imported the same day from the cross-audited sister
#   asset PromptPartner/agentsmith (tracks/_audit/session_2026_07_26_agentsmith-sister.md), and the
#   single measured false positive they carry (the AWS documentation key), so a future pattern edit
#   cannot silently re-open either direction.
#
# WHY BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE PINNED: a gate is only calibrated if it separates a known-positive from
# a known-negative. Pinning blocks alone would let an over-broad pattern pass this check while
# training PUBLIC_SURFACE_OK into muscle memory — an over-blocking gate is a disarmed gate.
#
# Runs in a THROWAWAY git repo (mktemp): it never touches this repo's index or worktree.
# Usage: bash scripts/universal_guard_check.sh    → exit 0 all pairs hold, 1 otherwise.

# test_tag_version_lanes.sh — known-pair anchor for the pre-push tag/version consistency guard.
#
# WHY (measured 2026-08-02): a release tag was pushed onto the WRONG commit. `git pull --ff-only`
# had failed with a diverging-branches error that went unread, so `main` was still the pre-release
# tree; the tag landed there and `npm publish` was then attempted from that same tree. The ONLY
# thing that stopped the publish was npm's own "cannot publish over 1.4.84" collision check.
# Publishing does not un-happen — being saved by the registry's bookkeeping is luck, not a floor.
#
# Built at N=1 on purpose. This repo's escalation rule ("1-2 occurrences -> prose, N>=3 -> mechanize")
# is scoped to REVERSIBLE surfaces; a wrong tag on a public repo plus a publish from the wrong tree
# is the irreversible class, where the Surface-Class Degrade Invariant says fail-CLOSED immediately.
#
# The lanes drive the REAL hook through its real stdin contract (`<local_ref> <local_sha>
# <remote_ref> <remote_sha>`), not a re-spelling of its predicate — a hand-copied condition is a
# divergent normalizer and drifts lenient.
#
# Exit 0 = the guard discriminates · 1 = it would let a mismatched tag through, or block a good one.

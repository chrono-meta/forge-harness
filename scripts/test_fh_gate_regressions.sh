# test_fh_gate_regressions.sh — mechanical regression tests for the fh-gate verdict surface.
#
# Every case here reproduces a hole that was CONFIRMED open in v1.4.59 and closed in v1.4.60.
# They exist because two decorrelated models agreeing that a fix is correct is still judgment;
# these are the anchor. A case failing means a closed hole has reopened.
#
# Findings origin (2026-07-16 pre-publish audit of the shipped surface):
#   - cross-field verdict invariant   : codex gpt-5.5 (cross-family), strongest finding
#   - FH_TIMEOUT command injection    : Claude sub-agent (same-family) — codex missed it
#   - fence escape / task-desc fence  : Claude sub-agent (same-family)
#   - dry-run PASS, impossible-zero   : both
#
# Run: bash scripts/test_fh_gate_regressions.sh

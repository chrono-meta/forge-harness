# Every case here reproduces a hole that was CONFIRMED open in v1.4.59 and closed in v1.4.60.
# They exist because two decorrelated models agreeing that a fix is correct is still judgment;
# these are the anchor. A case failing means a closed hole has reopened.
#
# Findings origin (2026-07-16 pre-publish audit of the shipped surface):
#   - cross-field verdict invariant   : codex gpt-5.5 (cross-family), strongest finding
#   - FH_TIMEOUT command injection    : Claude sub-agent (same-family) — codex missed it
#   - fence escape / task-desc fence  : Claude sub-agent (same-family)
#   - dry-run PASS, impossible-zero   : both

# Review SUBJECT — a fixture this suite creates, NOT a file it hopes the repo has.
# Every gate invocation below used the literal `package.json` as its subject. That is an npm-package
# assumption smuggled into a test: this suite passed here only because this repo happens to ship one.
# MEASURED 2026-08-16 in a sibling harness that carries this file verbatim and ships no package.json:
# every lane that actually invokes the gate on a file returned 10 ("0 of N targets resolved →
# harness error") — 12 failures from this one hardcoded fixture, on top of 18 more from the same
# missing file killing the gate's version read outright. The suite was measuring the fixture's
# existence, not the gate's behaviour. A test that only runs in the repo it was written in is not a
# regression anchor; it is a local habit.

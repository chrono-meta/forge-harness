#
# WHAT IS BEING GUARDED
#   A backtick inside a shell DOUBLE-QUOTING CONTEXT — an unquoted heredoc body (`<<EOF`) or a
#   "double-quoted string" — is command substitution: the text between the backticks is REPLACED by
#   the command's output. With no such command the output is empty, so the text is DELETED; with one,
#   foreign content is INSERTED. The sentence stays grammatical (only its subject is gone), the only
#   signal is one `command not found` line at the top of the output, and every marker/record hook
#   checks a field's presence, not its completeness.
#   Measured 7× (2026-08-10 · 2026-09-01 ×3 · 2026-09-02 ×4 — marker, RESULT doc, fh_completed echo ×2)
#   with a resident memory rule that failed each time because the actor's task had a different NAME
#   (writing a marker · a failure message · a seal). N≥3 → mechanize (weekly_audit_2026-09-02 HIGH #1).

#   BT1 — unquoted heredoc body (`<<TAG`, `<<-TAG`; NOT `<<'TAG'` / `<<"TAG"` / `<<\TAG`) containing `
#   BT2 — double-quoted string containing ` (single-quoted text and `\`` are literal → CLEAN)
#
# Surface = the Bash tool call itself (interactively-composed commands), same reasoning as
# pipe_verdict_guard: every recurrence was in a composed command, none in a shipped file.

#
# ── WHAT THIS ANSWERS THAT THE SUITE CANNOT ANSWER ABOUT ITSELF ──────────────────────────────
# A green lane suite has two possible causes: the gate is healthy, or the suite stopped testing
# anything. In a log those are byte-identical, and the second is how an anchor becomes decorative
# (CLAUDE.md / [[feedback_anchor_can_be_decorative]]: "되돌려도 초록"). Presence of a control is
# not discrimination — the question is whether the suite is CAPABLE of going red, and the only way
# to know is to break the gate on purpose and watch.
#
# So: disable one guard ON A COPY, re-run the suite against that copy, and require it to go red on
# the SPECIFIC lane that guard backs. Red-for-any-reason is not enough — a suite that dies from a
# missing dependency is also non-zero and would satisfy a bare exit-code check while proving
# nothing ([[feedback_gate_verification_must_execute]]: "막혔다"≠"옳게 막혔다").
#
# ── WHY A COPY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The real tree is never touched. This repo is a SHARED CHECKOUT (CLAUDE.md §병렬세션): mutating a
# tracked file here, even with an intended restore, puts another session's worktree at risk and can
# be swallowed into someone else's commit. Copy-mutate-discard has no restore step to forget.
#
# Seven stages, in order, each of which can fail the probe on its own:
#   ① APPLY  — verify the mutation actually landed (an unapplied mutation makes "still green" mean
#              nothing, which is the failure mode this whole file exists to name)
#   ② RUN    — the suite must exit non-zero AND name the expected lane
#   ③ DISCARD— drop the copy
#   ④ PORTABILITY  — the suite must still be GREEN under a git that has no `init -b` (< 2.28)
#   ⑤ SETUP-LOUDNESS — when the fixture cannot be built at all, the suite must abort with
#              HARNESS_ERROR and score ZERO lanes, never grade the real tree
#   ⑥ ORPHAN   — templates/predelete_check.test.sh still has a REACHABLE executing runner (no other
#              detector can see that file — it is outside lane_runner_check.sh's glob). The counter
#              carries its own known pairs (⑥-cal): one per surface (.yml · .yaml · package.json)
#              and one per reachability rule (manual-only trigger · `if: false` · comment-only ·
#              `on:`-scope). 🟥 It is a COMMON-FORM MATCHER, not a YAML/shell semantics analyzer —
#              what it does and does not catch is enumerated at §NAMED LIMITS above count_execs,
#              and unrecognised shapes fold to NOT-reachable (the loud direction) on purpose
#   ⑦ CONTAINMENT — running the suite leaves the REAL repository byte-identical
#
# ④–⑦ were added 2026-08-22 as the regression anchors for that day's repairs, and they live here
# rather than in the suite because each is a question ABOUT the suite ("is it still runnable · is
# it honest when it cannot run · is its subject still wired · does it stay inside its sandbox")
# which a suite cannot ask about itself.
#
# Portability, stated because the suite it controls claims "git + coreutils only" and this file does
# NOT: stage ① uses `python3` for the mutation (already a de-facto dependency here —
# scripts/selfcheck.sh, scripts/lane_runner_check.sh and scripts/residency_closure_scan.py all need
# it; re-grounded 2026-08-22 R3 against TRACKED files only, because the first draft cited a sibling
# script from an unlanded branch and would have shipped a phantom reference) and stage ⑦'s diff uses bash
# process substitution. Named rather than assumed; if python3 is absent, stage ① fails LOUDLY
# ("LIVENESS PROBE INVALID") and never reports "still green".
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_prepush_destructive_liveness.sh   → exit 0 anchor is live, 1 otherwise.

# ── EVIDENCE ECHO — the probe's EVIDENCE must not wear the AGGREGATOR's failure glyph ────────
# 🟥 This is a seam between two individually-correct roles ([[feedback_two_roles_one_file_unowned_conflict]]).
#   · scripts/selfcheck.sh decides a suite failed by grepping its output for `❌` (_show_failure,
#     and the lane loop streams suite stdout straight into the CI log).
#   · THIS file is a revert probe. Its evidence IS a red line: "I disabled the guard and the lane
#     that backs it went red." So it re-prints the subject suite's red lines on purpose.
# Same glyph, opposite meanings. Measured consequence (2026-09-19, run 35426860480): the CI log
# carried `✅ P4 delete INTEGRATION branch` and `❌ P4 delete INTEGRATION branch` two seconds apart,
# BOTH correct, and the same lane was misattributed twice in a row by a human reading the log —
# once as "flaky", once as "selfcheck counts the intended red as a failure". Nothing was broken;
# the log was unreadable. And one mechanical hole was left: if this probe ever exits non-zero, the
# aggregator's report mixes intended reds with real ones and has no way to tell them apart.
#
# The fix belongs HERE, not in the aggregator. An exemption list in selfcheck ("liveness is
# special") leaks again at the next revert probe; re-tokenising at the source does not.
# The evidentiary value is the FACT that the lane reddened, never the character used to say so
# ([[feedback_compare_beats_pinning_a_constant]] — do not pin a glyph you do not own).
#
# INVARIANT this establishes, and what the anchor asserts (scripts/test_liveness_echo_token_lanes.sh):
#   `❌` appears in THIS probe's stdout only on lines THIS probe authored, at column 0.
#   Everything re-printed from a subject suite is indented, prefixed `   | `, and its reds read
#   `[expected-red]`. A green run therefore emits zero `❌`, and in a red run every `❌` is real.
# 🟥 Substitution only — never deletion. A probe that hides the red line stops being evidence, so
# the anchor also asserts the re-tokenised line is still THERE.

# ── ④ PORTABILITY CONTROL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Regression anchor for the 2026-08-22 `git init -b main` repair. `-b` needs git >= 2.28; anything
# older rejects it outright ("unknown switch `b'", rc 129) and the fixture never gets built. The
# runner image and the operator's macOS both ship a new git, so NOTHING here would notice the
# reintroduction — which is precisely why it survived review the first time.
#
# The shim is a targeted reproduction, not a whole old git: it removes the ONE switch whose absence
# defines git < 2.28 and passes everything else through. Named scope: it does not reproduce other
# 2.28-era differences, and `git --version` still reports the real version.
#
# 🟥 WHAT THAT UNMEASURED SCOPE DOES AND DOES NOT AFFECT (adjudicated 2026-08-22 R2, because an
# unqualified "partial reproduction" reads as "the repair might be wrong", and it is not):
#   • It does NOT affect the repair's justification. The repair swapped `git init -b main` for
#     `git init` + `git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main`. Its correctness needs only that the
#     replacement predates 2.28 — `symbolic-ref` and `update-ref` are 1.x-era plumbing — and that
#     `-b` is genuinely the breaking switch, which the shim's own known pair measures directly.
#   • It DOES bound what stage ④ can claim. ④ proves "no dependency on `init -b`", not "runs on
#     git 2.27". Enumerated rather than assumed: every git call in the lanes suite is
#     add · branch · checkout (incl. --detach, 1.7.5) · commit · config · init -q · rev-parse
#     (incl. --show-toplevel, 1.7.x) · symbolic-ref · tag · update-ref — all pre-2.28, so the
#     residual is a coverage limit on the CONTROL, not an open question about the SUBJECT.
#   • Closing it properly needs a real old git (a container with 2.27), which is a CI decision, not
#     something a shim can fake. Recorded as a named limit; not claimed closed.

# 🟥 The SURFACE LIST is the part that has been wrong, and it was wrong in a direction that produces
# a FALSE ORPHAN (over-block), not a false pass. Two repairs, both 2026-08-22 R2:
#   • `.yaml` — GitHub executes BOTH `.github/workflows/*.yml` AND `*.yaml`. Renaming
#     destructive-op-anchor.yml to .yaml would leave the runner fully live in CI while this stage
#     reported ORPHANED. Measured: no `.yaml` exists in .github today, so nothing here would have
#     noticed — the same "the runner image happens to agree with me" blindness that let `init -b`
#     through in stage ④.
#   • `package.json` — `npm test` / `prepublishOnly` are real executing surfaces; a suite wired
#     only from there was invisible. Verified NOT to false-positive on the `files[]` entry for this
#     very path (files[] has no `bash `/`sh ` prefix, so the exec pattern does not match it).
# Named residual (unclosed, measured): `bin/*.js` is NOT in the list — probed, and no file there
# executes a shell suite today (`grep -nE 'bash '` over bin/*.js → 0 hits, control: the same grep
# hits in scripts/*.sh). If a JS entrypoint ever shells out to a suite, this list is short again.
#
# 🟥 REACHABILITY (ⓒ) — presence of the invocation text is not execution. A workflow triggered only
# by `workflow_dispatch`, or whose step is `if: false`, contains the exact line and runs never. That
# is [[feedback_not_found_is_not_zero_family]] inverted: a DEAD path rendered as EXECUTED. Workflow
# files therefore additionally require a push/pull_request trigger and no `if: false`.
#
# 🟥 WHAT THIS COUNTER CLAIMS, STATED NARROWLY (rewritten 2026-08-22 R3 after a codex reproduction).
# It is a COMMON-FORM MATCHER, not a YAML/shell semantics analyzer, and it never claimed to be one
# without leaking. The R2 wording called both tests "file-scoped greps … coarse on purpose", which
# reads as one accepted imprecision; measuring it showed the coarseness ran in BOTH directions at
# once, and one of those directions is unsafe:
#   • UNSAFE (fixed) — the trigger test matched any indented `push:` ANYWHERE in the file, so a
#     manual-only workflow with `env:\n  push: not-a-trigger` was counted REACHABLE. A dead runner
#     certified as live is a green ⑥ over a returned orphan, which is the one outcome this stage
#     exists to prevent. Measured pre-fix: fixture `envpush` → 1 (want 0).
#   • OVER-BLOCK (also fixed, because it was silent) — that same colon-anchored pattern REJECTED
#     `on: push` and `on: [push, pull_request]`, the two ordinary inline spellings. Measured
#     pre-fix: `onscalar` → 0 and `oninline` → 0 (want 1 each). Nobody would have noticed until a
#     rename of the real runner's trigger style turned ⑥ red for a reason that is not a finding.
#
# The replacement is a purpose-built `on:`-BLOCK EXTRACTOR, not a YAML parser — deliberately, since
# a parser is both a dependency this suite does not have and the scope R3 judged too large. It
# recognises exactly one YAML structure: a top-level key ends where the next column-0 key begins.
# That is enough, and the reason it is enough is specific rather than optimistic: the whole defect
# class here is "a `push:` token that belongs to some OTHER top-level key", and top-level key
# boundaries are the minimum structure that separates those. Anything finer (anchors, merge keys,
# multi-line flow scalars spanning column 0) is out of scope and folds the safe way, below.
#
# 🟥 DEGRADE DIRECTION, FIXED AND EXPLICIT — when the shape is not recognised, fold to NOT REACHABLE.
# The two errors are not symmetric: an undercount makes ⑥ print "❌ ORPHANED" (loud, red, a human
# looks at a file that is in fact fine), while an overcount makes ⑥ print a green line while nothing
# executes the subject (silent, and indistinguishable from health — [[feedback_not_found_is_not_zero_family]]).
# One is a wasted five minutes; the other is the anchor this stage guards going missing without a
# sound. So: no `on:` block found · an unrecognised trigger spelling · a `push:` nested deeper than a
# direct child of `on:` → all count as NOT reachable. The over-block twins (`oninline` · `onscalar` ·
# `onquoted`) exist so that this bias is measured rather than allowed to drift into blocking
# everything ([[feedback_overblock_traded_for_failopen]]).
#
# 🟥 NAMED LIMITS — what this counter does NOT catch (it is a matcher; these need real semantics):
#   • `if: false` is still FILE-scoped, not step-scoped: an `if: false` on an unrelated step
#     disqualifies the whole file. Left as-is on purpose — that is the over-block direction.
#   • Only the literal `false` is recognised. `if: ${{ false }}`, `if: github.event_name == 'never'`,
#     or a job-level `if:` are not modelled; a step guarded that way counts as reachable (overcount).
#   • A `paths:`/`branches:` filter that can never match is not modelled — such a workflow counts as
#     reachable.
#   • Shell dead code counts: `if false; then bash …; fi`, or an invocation inside a function that
#     is never called, is an executing runner as far as this counter is concerned.
#   • A `jobs:`-level `if:`, a `needs:` chain that can never satisfy, and reusable-workflow
#     (`workflow_call`) indirection are all unmodelled.
#   • In the OVER-BLOCK direction (loud, so accepted rather than fixed): only `push`/`pull_request`
#     count as triggers. A runner reached solely by `schedule:`, `release:`, `workflow_run:` or
#     `workflow_call:` really does execute and would be reported ORPHANED. Measured, not assumed —
#     a `schedule:`-only fixture reads `dead` here. Widening the set is a one-line change IF such a
#     runner ever exists; today none does, and every added trigger widens the unsafe direction too.
#   The only thing that truly settles reachability is EXECUTING the runner and watching the subject
#   run, which is what CI's 'Anchor 3/3' step does; ⑥ guards that step's existence, it does not
#   replace it ([[feedback_gate_binding_point_not_check_point]]).

# 🟥 RESIDUAL 4, RE-ADJUDICATED TWICE — "⑥ counts CALLERS, not EXECUTIONS".
# The R1 wording conceded the whole axis; the R2 wording then overclaimed the opposite. Both are
# corrected here rather than overwritten, because the overclaim is the instructive half:
#   R2 said "CLOSED for workflows — manual-only and `if: false` are THE two ways a workflow can hold
#     the invocation text and never run it". 🟥 That "the two" was a completeness claim made without
#     enumerating the candidates, and R3 falsified it in one try: a `push:` key under `env:` is a
#     third way, and the file-scoped trigger grep counted it as live
#     ([[feedback_candidate_list_completeness]]). The honest statement is NARROWER and is not a
#     count: three SPELLINGS are now rejected with their own known pairs (manual-only · `if: false` ·
#     a `push:` outside the `on:` block or below its direct children). No claim is made that the
#     list is complete — §NAMED LIMITS above enumerates the ones known to be missing.
#   OPEN, and measured rather than hand-waved: an invocation sitting in a dead branch of a SHELL
#     runner (`if false; then bash …`, an uncalled function) still counts, and a `paths:` filter
#     that never matches is not modelled. Live exposure TODAY is ZERO: the only counted runner is
#     .github/workflows/destructive-op-anchor.yml (measured with a control — the same scan finds 5
#     runners for scripts/selfcheck.sh, so the single hit is a measurement, not a dead grep), and
#     it triggers on `push: branches: ['**']`. So the open half is a future exposure, not a
#     present one.
#   The only form that truly closes it is EXECUTING the runner and observing the subject run —
#     which is what CI's 'Anchor 3/3' step does. ⑥ is the guard on that step's continued
#     existence, not a substitute for it ([[feedback_gate_binding_point_not_check_point]]).


# ── ⑦ CONTAINMENT CONTROL — the suite must not touch the REAL repo ───────────────────────────
# 🟥 This is the anchor for a leak that actually happened, on 2026-08-22, in this shared checkout:
# a run of the pre-fix suite created branches (merged-branch · newer-content · unique-work), a tag
# (v9.9.9), an untracked a.txt, left `unique.txt` STAGED IN THE INDEX, and stranded HEAD on a
# fixture branch. A sibling lane's session found it, not this one.
#
# Mechanism, reproduced rather than guessed: `newrepo` returns 1 WITHOUT echoing, so `R=$(newrepo)`
# is empty, and `cd ""` is a NO-OP SUCCESS in bash — every `( cd "$R" && git … )` then ran with cwd
# = the real repo. Repair ⑤ closes the door (no fixture → abort). THIS stage is the independent
# check on the OUTCOME, because a future leak may arrive through a door ⑤ does not watch: a lane
# that forgets `cd`, a `git -C` pointed at the wrong root, a helper that resolves REPO_ROOT.
# Door-check and outcome-check are different axes; ⑤ alone would have been the same class of
# half-measure ([[feedback_gate_binding_point_not_check_point]]).
#
# In a SHARED CHECKOUT the stake is higher than a dirty tree: a staged fixture file is committed by
# whoever commits next ([[feedback_shared_checkout_ops_touch_others_work]]).

# 🟥 THE BASELINE IS TAKEN AT THE TOP OF THIS FILE, NOT HERE — and that placement is the whole
# check. A first draft snapshotted at this point, i.e. AFTER stages ②/④/⑤ had each already run the
# suite. A revert probe with a deliberately-leaking stand-in then reported "byte-identical": the
# leak had already landed during ④, so it was inside the baseline and the comparison saw no delta.
# An IDEMPOTENT leak (create-if-absent, add-if-unstaged) is invisible to any baseline taken after
# the first run. Anchors are measured by what they can still catch, not by what they caught once
# ([[feedback_anchor_can_be_decorative]]) — so the baseline moved to before the first invocation
# and now covers every suite run this probe performs.

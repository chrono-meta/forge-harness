# sync_guard_check.sh — known-pair anchor for the one-way sync's destination-newer guard.
#
# WHY
# On 2026-07-26 two consecutive sessions lost a session card: each wrote it into the companion
# store (which is where the session-start rule tells an agent to read from), and the next one-way
# sync silently overwrote it with the older canonical copy. v9 (7,567 B) -> v8 (5,299 B), then v10
# the same way. No checker caught it — the close-check complained about timestamp ORDER, an
# adjacent symptom, while the actual event was an overwrite. Discovery was accidental.
#
# `sync-to-be.sh` now aborts when a destination file is newer than its source. This file is that
# guard's regression anchor, because a guard nobody re-tests degrades into a comment.
#
# It asserts BOTH directions, because a guard that only ever blocks is as broken as one that never
# does — over-blocking trains the operator to set the override reflexively, and at that moment the
# gate becomes decoration. That failure mode is not hypothetical: the guard's own first
# calibration run over-blocked (it scanned `logs/`, which the transport excludes) and would have
# aborted every normal sync.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/sync_guard_check.sh     # exit 0 = both directions hold

# nothing. Kept on its own counter and its own exit code so the two are distinguishable from the
# exit status alone, not merely in the log text (Wave-1 finding, 2026-08-02: a distinct message
# folded into a shared exit code is not a distinct signal to CI).
# **3, not 2** — bash returns 2 for a script SYNTAX ERROR, so claiming 2 would make a rotted script
# report itself as a benign fixture issue and send the reader hunting mtimes instead of reading the
# parse error. Exit codes are a shared namespace; do not squat on one the shell already owns.

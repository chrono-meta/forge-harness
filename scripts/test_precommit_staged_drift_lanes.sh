#
# WHAT IT GUARDS. "The tree you verified is not the tree you commit" happened FOUR times in one
# day (2026-08-29/30) and a DIFFERENT instrument caught each one — which is luck, not coverage:
#   ⑴ a pathspec failure was ignored and the verification credited to the commit anyway
#   ⑵ a file was edited AFTER `git add`
#   ⑶ a detector read the git index while the author ran it against the worktree
#   ⑷ the caller-ratchet could not see new wiring until it was staged
# Only shape ⑵ is computable at commit time, and it is: `git diff` ∩ `git diff --cached`.
# This suite pins that computation, not the judgement about whether the drift matters.
#
# 🟥 SCOPE — channel, never conclusion. The gate says "these two byte streams diverged" and stops.
# It must NEVER block: partial/hunk staging is legitimate practice, and a gate that fires on it
# trains `--no-verify`, which disarms the Destructive-Op gate living in the same hook. So there is
# no BLOCK lane here on purpose — the absence is the design, and L5 pins it.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_precommit_staged_drift_lanes.sh   Exit: 0 = all behave; 1 = regression.

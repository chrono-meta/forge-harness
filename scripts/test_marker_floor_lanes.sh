# test_marker_floor_lanes.sh — regression fixtures for pre-commit validate_marker_floor lanes.
#
# Ships with the 2026-07-10 sonnet-floor lane (Sonnet-Floor Doctrine): each closed hole gets a
# mechanical regression test (Field-Harness Load-Bearing Change Gate convergence condition).
# Fixtures assert BOTH directions: the new lane admits exactly its intended shape, and every
# pre-existing guard still blocks (no degrade-toward-permissive regression).
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_marker_floor_lanes.sh   Exit: 0 = all fixtures behave; 1 = regression.

# Script-relative, NOT `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. Measured 2026-08-13 in a vendored tree
# (npm install, then `git init` at a level above — a monorepo committing node_modules is the
# same shape): rev-parse answers with the OUTER repo's root, so this suite looked for the
# package's own files inside somebody else's checkout, found nothing, and reported
# HARNESS-ERROR. The consumer sees a red `npm test` caused entirely by where their .git is.
# The subject of these lanes ships INSIDE this package, so the package root is the only root
# that can be right. Same form as test_capability_entrypoint_shipping.sh:29.
# The exposure is new: before these suites were wired into selfcheck.sh they ran nowhere, so
# the wrong root never cost anything. Wiring a dead lane surfaces every assumption it made.

# EXTRACTION CALIBRATION — the sibling suite (test_marker_crossfamily_lanes.sh) has had this and
# this file did not. Without it, ANY failure to extract renders as a REGRESSION rather than as a
# broken instrument: an empty fn.sh means `run()` sources nothing, validate_marker_floor is
# undefined, `bash -c` exits non-zero, every fixture reads as BLOCK, and the three lanes that
# expect PASS "fail" — a red suite pointing at a gate that is perfectly fine. Measured 2026-08-13
# in a vendored git tree, where the old `git rev-parse` root sent $HOOK into another repo entirely.
# The root is fixed above; this guard is what makes the NEXT extraction failure legible instead of
# a false accusation, whatever causes it (a renamed function, a reformatted hook, a truncated file).
# exit 10, matching the harness-error contract selfcheck.sh's pair-loop routes to HARNESS ERROR.

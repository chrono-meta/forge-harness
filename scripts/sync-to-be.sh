# This script is shared verbatim with recognized sibling hubs (e.g. PMH) that mirror to the SAME
# companion store. A non-FH hub's destination dirs get a "-<tag>" suffix (tracks-meta-pmh/, etc.)
# so two hubs never collide on one shared path — see the HUB_SUFFIX guard below. A hub not on that
# list refuses (non-zero exit) rather than writing anywhere.
# Runs from a CC Stop hook (throttled) or manually.
# Override paths via env: HUB_DIR, BE_DIR.
# Usage: bash scripts/sync-to-be.sh [--quiet] [--init]
#   --init   explicitly CREATE the companion store at $BE (mkdir -p + git init -q, one log line saying
#            what was made where). Without it a destination that is not an existing git work tree is
#            REFUSED (rc=12) — a typo in BE_DIR / FH_COMPANION_STORE must never silently clone the
#            private half somewhere new (fh_signal_2026-09-05_sync-guard-failopen-and-alarm-fatigue ⓐ).
# EXIT:  0 = mirrored (or nothing to do)
#        1 = destination-newer guard tripped and the return path does NOT recover it — or any set -e
#            mid-run failure (fail-closed: a red wall, read it)
#        2 = destination-newer, RECOVERABLE: another node advanced and `sync-from-be.sh --dry-run`
#            reports review 0 — nothing was written; run the return path, then re-run (ⓑ, 2026-09-05).
#            Nothing is recovered automatically — only the tone of the message changes.
#        4 = companion store resolves to the hub itself (refuse to commit private content into the hub)
#       10 = $FH is not a recognized hub ("not applicable here" — the Stop hook stamps on 0 or 10)
#       12 = destination guard: $BE is not the ROOT of an existing git work tree (missing · not a dir ·
#            subdirectory of another repo · bare · submodule · a git too old to rule out a submodule —
#            compared by physical path) and --init was not given, or --init could not create it
#            atomically (fail-closed: zero trace), or the store STOPPED being the root of its own work
#            tree mid-run, or its git identity (git dir · common dir) changed mid-run (mirrored, nothing
#            committed — R3 B6 · R4 S1 root re-check · R5 S1 identity pin). Repo-selecting GIT_* env is
#            unset at start so a hook's environment cannot redirect the store (R5 S2). An independent repo whose root sits inside another
#            repo's tree is accepted on purpose (R3 A4, lane B8m). Once validated, every write goes
#            through the PHYSICAL path (R3 S1, lane B8n) and the default destination is derived from
#            the physical hub (R3 S2, lane B8l).
# 🟡 Stop-hook interaction (not testable by the lanes — the hook lives in .claude/settings.local.json,
#    outside the repo): the hook stamps its cooldown only on rc 0/10, so rc=2 is NOT stamped → the
#    3-line notice repeats on every Stop until the return path is run. Whether the hook should also
#    stamp on 2 is a local decision; this script only changed a 21-line wall into 3 lines for that case.
#
# ── WHO TURNS THIS ON, AND ITS SIBLING ────────────────────────────────────────
# This script is one of TWO one-way mirror modes. They differ by AUDIENCE, not mechanism, and
# naming them that way is the point — a reader should be able to tell in one line whether it is
# theirs:
#
#   sync-to-be   (this file) — for someone keeping a PERSONAL research wiki in separate storage.
#                Direction: hub (canonical) → private companion store. Nothing here is shared;
#                the store exists so the public repo + the private half together form one whole
#                project, and so a machine reclaim does not take the private half with it.
#
#   sync-to-org  (sibling, per-org) — for someone syncing an ORGANIZATION-SHARED wiki.
#                Direction: personal canonical → the shared surface the org reads. Same transport,
#                different blast radius: a bad write is visible to other people, so the org mode
#                additionally owes residency review of what crosses (format may cross; private
#                notes and personal directory layout may not).
#
# **Both modes inherit the destination-newer guard below.** That guard is not personal-mode
# housekeeping — it is the floor for one-way mirroring as such, and the org mode needs it MORE:
# in personal mode a silent overwrite loses your own note, in org mode it can lose someone
# else's. Any new mirror mode starts by inheriting it, not by re-deciding it.
#
# Choosing: personal store → this file. Org-shared surface → the org variant, and run a residency
# pass on the crossing set first. Both → run both; they have different destinations and the guard
# keeps them from fighting.

# 🟥 R5 S2 (codex, 2026-09-05): every `git` below must address the store BY PATH. Repo-selecting
# environment (a git hook exports GIT_DIR; a caller may carry GIT_WORK_TREE / GIT_INDEX_FILE …) makes
# `git -C "$BE" rev-parse` answer for the ENV-selected repository — a plain directory would then pass
# the root check and `git add/commit` would land the private half in that other repo. Unset them
# first; nothing here legitimately needs them (lane B8r).

# THREAT MODEL (stated so severity can be graded against it): the operator's own machine, the
# operator's own store. The guard defends against TYPOS, symlinks, logical/physical path splits,

# hook's environment) — not against an adversary who can rewrite the store between two lines of this
# script; such an adversary can rewrite the script itself. Cheap belts against mid-run change are
# still taken where they cannot over-block (identity pin below), and named as belts, not floors.

# With a symlinked HUB_DIR (`/tmp/fh-link → /real/forge-harness`) the logical form `$FH/../fh-be`
# splits in two: the kernel resolves it to /real/fh-be for cp/mkdir/`git -C`, but bash's logical `cd`
# takes it to /tmp/fh-be — files mirrored in one repo, `git add/commit` run in another. Deriving from
# the physical hub keeps the whole run in one place; an explicit BE_DIR is taken as given, and is
# pinned to its physical path once the guard has validated it (S1 below) — that pin is what closes
# the split for every spelling; this derivation keeps the requested path sane before the guard.

# Hub-identity guard (fail-closed): $FH is context-derived (CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR), and this is the

# registered globally, or CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR points at a field project — else a wrong project's
# memory / CLAUDE.local.md would be pushed into the companion store. (Axis-2 challenger 2026-07-05 [B].)
# A refusal exits NON-ZERO — the earlier `exit 0` made a refusal indistinguishable from success to
# every caller (Stop hook, close-chain gate), so a rejected sync silently never ran (pmh-dev#68 ①).
# The code is 10, not 1: this branch now only fires for a hub that is genuinely neither FH nor PMH
# (both of THOSE proceed normally below), so it is the same "not applicable here" case
# sync-from-be.sh already gives its own dedicated code — reserving 1 for a recognized hub that
# errors mid-run (via this script's `set -e`). The distinction matters to the Stop hook specifically:
# it gates its cooldown stamp on this script's exit status (`sync-to-be.sh --quiet && echo $NOW >
# $FLAG`, .claude/settings.json), so an UNDIFFERENTIATED non-zero here — in any project that happens
# to carry this exact hook line but is neither hub — would never stamp the cooldown and re-run this
# guard on every single Stop, forever (Wave-1 review, pmh-dev#68). The hook is updated to treat 10
# the same as 0 for stamping purposes; a real failure (1, or any `set -e` exit) still doesn't stamp.
#
# HUB_SUFFIX namespaces this hub's destination paths under $BE. Two hubs sharing one companion
# store (FH + a sibling, siblings on the same machine, BE derived the same way from each) would
# otherwise both write "tracks-meta/" — the sibling's card would silently overwrite FH's card in the
# exact same file (pmh-dev#68 ②). FH keeps the unsuffixed legacy paths (canonical, oldest, most
# tooling depends on them); a recognized sibling hub gets its own "-<tag>" namespace. A hub this
# script cannot identify refuses rather than guessing a namespace for it.
#
# Resolution itself lives in fh_hub_identity.sh, shared with sync-from-be.sh and
# fh_session_load.sh — see that file's header for why a sibling hub's identifying text is never
# hardcoded in a script that ships in the PUBLIC repo, and why factoring this out (rather than three
# hand-copies) is what a PR review caught was missing: a copy that fixes the write side and forgets
# to fix the two read sides in lockstep is exactly the drift a single sourced source-of-truth closes.

# any of this, so $BE only ever had ONE writer (this hub's own Stop hook, throttled to one run per
# 300s). Now FH and PMH can both be inside it at once — un-serialized, that lets one hub's `git
# rebase --abort` (in maybe_push, below) tear down the OTHER hub's live `git pull --rebase`, or let
# one hub's add/commit land mid-write of the other's. The lock is acquired HERE — before the mirror
# phase below ever touches $BE — not later next to the git operations: git add/commit only stage
# what THIS run explicitly adds, so a same-namespace collision there was already narrow, but the
# mirror phase (`sync_dir`/`sync_file`, all rsync/tar/cp) writes files on disk with no such
# scoping, and codex's review is right that letting it run lock-free just moves the race earlier
# instead of closing it — a busy-lock timeout used to return 0 *after* dirtying the shared tree.
# `flock` would be the obvious tool but ships on neither stock macOS (this operator's platform) nor
# BSD — `mkdir` is atomic on every POSIX filesystem and needs no external binary. Shared (unsuffixed)

#
# ── Destination guard (fail-closed) — BEFORE the lock mkdir, before anything touches $BE ──────────
# Measured 2026-09-05: `BE_DIR=/tmp/__nonexistent__ bash sync-to-be.sh` created that path and mirrored
# the private half into it — 838+93+61 files, 15 MB, rc=0, no warning. A single typo in the
# documented `export FH_COMPANION_STORE=...` line therefore cloned tracks/_meta, memory/ and
# CLAUDE.local.md to an arbitrary directory, silently. That is the publish direction, so it fails
# CLOSED here: the destination must ALREADY be the root of a git work tree, or the caller must
# say `--init` — an explicit act that logs what it makes and where. "The destination does not exist"
# never means "it may be created" (CLAUDE.md §Irreversibility: applicable-but-missing ≠ not-applicable).
# 🟥 R2 (codex cross-family, 2026-09-05): "inside SOME git work tree" was too weak — a typo that lands
# in an existing subdirectory of ANOTHER repository passed, and the private half went into a foreign
# repo (the original scenario, one level deeper). So the destination must be a git work tree's
# ROOT ITSELF, compared by PHYSICAL path (`cd -P && pwd -P` on both sides — a symlink that displays as
# a harmless BE= can resolve inside someone else's repo). Subdirectories, bare repos and submodules

# ── Destination-newer guard (fail-closed) ─────────────────────────────────────
# This transport is ONE-WAY: FH is canonical, the companion store is the mirror. rsync does not
# ask whether the destination is newer — it just overwrites. That is a SILENT data-loss path, and
# it fired twice: 2026-07-26, two consecutive sessions wrote a session card directly into the
# companion store (the session-start rule says "pull the companion store and read INDEX first",
# so the store is where an agent naturally starts reading — and therefore where it writes). The
# next sync replaced card v9 (7,567 B) with the older FH v8 (5,299 B); v10 went the same way.
# Neither loss was caught by a checker: the close-check reported "card-last violated", which is a
# TIMESTAMP-ORDER complaint, not an overwrite complaint — it was measuring an adjacent symptom.
# Discovery was accidental (someone noticed a byte count matching the old version).
#
# So: before overwriting, if the destination file is NEWER than its source, ABORT. Loss is
# irreversible; an unclear case stops rather than proceeds (§Irreversibility Surface-Class
# Degrade Invariant). Override channel matches the existing gates' shape: SYNC_OVERWRITE_OK=1,
# explicit and logged.
# SINGLE SOURCE for what this transport copies. The guard below and the rsync/tar calls MUST use
# the same set: a guard that inspects files the sync never writes produces false aborts, and one
# that misses files the sync does write produces false passes. (Measured on the first calibration
# run of this very guard: `logs/` is excluded from the copy but was being scanned, so a normal
# sync aborted on two launchd log files the transport never touches. Same divergence class the
# gate pathspec hit earlier the same day — two lists describing one thing.)
# `.fh_node_state` 는 **기계 고유** 상태다(노드 id·마지막 세션 시각·그 노드가 본 HEAD).

# pull_dir 경로가 이 파일을 배제 목록에 안 넣었더니, 두 노드가 같은 날 각자 한 번씩 닫아도
# 합집합이 내려와 "2번 닫음"으로 잘못 세고, session_close_check.sh 가 불필요한 재작업을

# to memory/_index/<MID>.md. The return path never pulls a peer's copies of them (sync-from-be.sh

# so a hub that somehow holds tracks/_meta/manifests/<peer>.yaml pushed it path-for-path onto the

# mtime-newer is the CHEAP screen, not the verdict. Measured 2026-07-28 (n=2 files, one run):
# after a successful sync this script COMMITS the companion store and, when another machine has

# ── Shared abort message for BOTH destination-newer sites ─────────────────────
# ONE function, deliberately: the file-level guard below was added because "a guard applied to some
# callers of a shared hazard is not a guard; it just relocates the hole". The same argument applies
# to the guard's MESSAGE — the two copies had already drifted (the dir-level one named a remedy the
# file-level one did not), and a remedy that exists in one branch is invisible from the other.
#
# MEASURED 2026-08-20 (air node, n=4 files, one run) — why the old wording was wrong:
#   The old text asserted ONE cause: "A newer file there means it was edited in the MIRROR."
#   All four files that tripped it had last been written by a `sync:` commit from ANOTHER NODE
#   (git log -1 on each: the pro node's own forward sync), and every mirror copy was a strict
#   superset of the hub's. Nothing had been edited in the mirror. The message was 0/4 correct.
#   Worse, its only escape hatch — SYNC_OVERWRITE_OK=1 — would have pushed this node's STALE copy
#   over the peer's newer work: the exact loss this guard exists to prevent, delivered by the guard's
#   own override. sync-from-be.sh has existed since 2026-08-02 for precisely this case and its own
#   header names this trap ("a guard whose only escape hatch is the data-loss button trains the
#   data-loss button") — but the forward script never cited it, so the fix was unreachable from the
#   moment of need. Gate-locality on a healing path: the remedy must be legible where the block fires.
#   Calibrated before citing: sync-from-be.sh --dry-run was run against all four and covers all four
#   (3 in its silent `clean` set, 1 in `review`). It is cited as the discriminator because it IS one,
#   not because it is adjacent.
# $2 = "pullable" (the return path covers these files) | "local-binding" (it does NOT).
# The second argument exists because a cross-family review (codex/gpt-5.6-terra, 2026-08-20) caught
# this fix REPRODUCING the very defect it closes: sync_file() has exactly ONE call site — the
# `sync_file "$FH/CLAUDE.local.md"` line below — and sync-from-be.sh refuses that file BY NAME
# (grep it there: the "is never pulled" exclusion note and the pair-list comment above pull_dir).
# 🟥 Anchors are NAMES, not line numbers, on purpose: the first version of this comment cited
# `:551` / `:576` and BOTH had already drifted by the time this branch was reviewed — the same
# commit that added these lines pushed them down. A number in prose is a phantom waiting for the
# next edit; a greppable string survives it.
# So a shared message citing the return path there is dead advice at 100% of that site's invocations.
# One message for two sites was right; one *remedy* for two sites was not.

# machine writes the same content, and append-only rsync merges them harmlessly). Three files
# are NOT: each hub clone keeps its OWN edit_manifest.yaml, its OWN memory index, and its OWN
# `.substrate_versions` (installed tool versions — added 2026-08-14, pmh-dev#69), because they
# describe THAT machine's local state. Mirroring them to one shared path makes every machine
# silently overwrite the others' record — measured 2026-07-15 for the manifest (three machines
# synced the same day and fh-be's manifest ended up 135 entries on one machine, 175 on another,
# no file actually lost but the backup rendered ambiguous) and separately for `.substrate_versions`
# on pmh-dev#69 (two nodes, silent auto-merge, one node's record overwritten with the other's — see
# the copy block below). So these three are keyed by machine. `.close_stamps_<date>` joins
# `.fh_node_state` in being excluded from this sync ENTIRELY instead (SYNC_EXCLUDES above) — it is
# also machine-scoped in nature, but has no companion-store consumer at all, so there is nothing to
# key. The session CARD is deliberately NOT keyed — it is the shared cross-machine handoff
# ("next session = <machine>"); splitting it would kill the function it exists for.

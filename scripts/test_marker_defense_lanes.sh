# test_marker_defense_lanes.sh — regression fixtures for pre-commit's validate_defense_leg
# (Wave 1-D defense line, 2026-08-20).
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL: the procedure was absorbed from a sibling harness whose own document
# asserted "the commit hook reads that line" and "pinned by scripts/test_marker_floor_lanes.sh".
# 🟥 Measured twice, with a control (`crossfamily` → 21 hits in the same file): BOTH claims were
# **0 hits** there. The prose was portable; the machine was not. This lane is the machine, built
# here, so that FH's own claim is true when FH makes it.
#
# Fixtures assert BOTH directions (known-pair): every intended shape is admitted, and every hole the
# leg closes still blocks. A suite that only asserts BLOCK cannot tell "blocked" from "blocked for
# the wrong reason"; one that only asserts PASS cannot see a leg that admits everything.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_marker_defense_lanes.sh   Exit: 0 = all behave; 1 = regression.

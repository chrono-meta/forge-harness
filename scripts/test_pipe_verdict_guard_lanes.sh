#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS WRITTEN BEFORE THE DETECTOR
#   2026-07-30 harvest #1: across a 5-round challenger run, three rounds contained a fix that
#   reverted an earlier fix — and the rounds that wrote the lane BEFORE touching the code had
#   zero such regressions. Convergence came from the ORDER, not the patch. So: lanes first.
#
# WHAT IS BEING GUARDED
#   Reading a verdict from `$?`/`${PIPESTATUS[…]}` after a pipeline, which yields the status of
#   the LAST stage. When the last stage is a display filter (`tail`, `head`, `cat`), that status
#   is the filter's — a FAILING gate reads as exit 0. Degrade direction: toward PASS.
#
#   R1 (deterministic, zero-FP): `${PIPESTATUS[...]}` under zsh. zsh spells it `$pipestatus[1]`
#       and 1-indexes it; the bash array expands to the EMPTY STRING. Any verdict read from it is
#       not merely wrong, it is absent. Measured 6× in this project's ad-hoc invocations.
#   R2 (heuristic, narrowed): pipeline whose FINAL stage is a display filter, followed by a read
#       of `$?`. Narrowed to display filters on purpose — see the FP lanes below.
#
# WHY A REPO-FILE LINTER IS THE WRONG SURFACE (measured 2026-07-31)
#   The prescription on the session card was "add an S6 class to degrade_direction_scan.sh".
#   Hand-verifying every `pipe + $?` hit in this repo's scripts returned 7 hits, 7 of them correct
#   (the last stage WAS the command under test in all 7). True positives in shipped files: 0.
#   All 6 measured recurrences were in interactively-composed commands, which no file scanner
#   reads. Shipping S6 would have been a 0-true-positive probe — exactly the failure S5's own
#   comment records ("100% FP trains dismissal of the one hit that will matter").

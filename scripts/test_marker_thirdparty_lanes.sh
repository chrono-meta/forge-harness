# test_marker_thirdparty_lanes.sh — regression fixtures for pre-commit's validate_thirdparty_leg.
#
# WHY: `thirdparty:` shipped 2026-08-17 with presence checked and the VALUE unvalidated. Within the
# same day the author wrote it wrong TWICE — free prose about peer-session contact — while a peer
# session used the enum correctly 4/4. ⓓ3자대면 is confronting third-party PRIOR ART (does this
# claimed-new thing already exist outside the repo), not "I talked to another session". Nothing
# caught the substitution because nothing read the value.
#
# 🟥 THE AXIS HAS TWO HALVES and the field originally encoded only one — ① prior art
# (checked/none-found) and ② harness-level adversarial review (peer-review): put a model in a THIRD
# harness, wearing that harness's persona, and have it review the target's change. FH is the
# governor — it creates the situation, observes, judges; the 4-axis gate verifies the OPINION that
# came back, locally. Because ② had no value, records that meant ② leaked into free prose. That is
# the very defect this field was created to fix, recurring one level in.
#
# SCOPE — channel, not judgment. These lanes assert the record is an enum member with non-vacuous
# grounds. They never assert the search was thorough, and never assert that what a third party
# said is TRUE: the axis exists to surface information you could not predict, and adjudicating what
# comes back belongs to the other axes. That separation is the point of the 4-axis gate.
#
# Fixtures assert BOTH directions. The real corpus supplied both arms on its own — that is unusual
# and worth stating: peer-authored markers were the known-negatives, the author's own malformed
# ones were the known-positives.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_marker_thirdparty_lanes.sh   Exit: 0 = all behave; 1 = regression.

#
# WHY (cross-family review rounds 1-3, 2026-07-29)
#   The accept-side consent-promotion rule went REJECT -> NARROW-IT -> NARROW-IT across three
#   adversarial rounds. Round 3 stopped attacking the prose and attacked the validator, and found
#   four ways the FLOOR ITSELF was fail-open. Three were confirmed against controls:
#
#     - `promotion_eligible: "false"` (quoted) is a truthy STRING. Every eligibility test inverted,
#       so an intended-ineligible class was granted. One quote character disarmed the floor.
#     - a duplicate class name silently shadowed the earlier entry, so appending an eligible twin
#       below an ineligible one laundered the ineligible class into a grant.
#     - `standing_consent: {inline: ...}` matched no pattern, so an EXPIRED inline grant was read as
#       "no standing consent recorded" and reported PASS — a grant the checker cannot see is not an
#       absent grant, it is a false clean.
#
#   Each of those is a check that reported green while doing nothing, which is worse than an absent
#   check: it buys confidence without enforcement. Hence this anchor.
#
# Lanes: N* = known-negative (must pass) · P* = known-positive (must be caught) · D* = degrade.
# Exit 0 = all lanes correct. Exit 1 = the validator regressed toward permissiveness.

# test_peer_worktree_detect_lanes.sh — regression anchor for ①-c peer detection across WORKTREES.
#
# CLOSES: session_close_check.sh ①-c placed peers by DIRECTORY PREFIX ("$FH"/*), which fails
# structurally for every worktree of the same repo — a worktree lives outside the main tree by
# definition. Measured 2026-08-22 (tracks/_meta/probe_2026-08-22_A2_replication.md): from the main
# tree the worktree peer moved NO counter at all; from a worktree the script printed a confident
# "✅ no live peer" while three live same-repo sessions were running.
#
# HERMETIC ON PURPOSE: this builds its OWN throwaway repo + worktree + processes + socket dir. It
# never reads /tmp/cc-socks and never depends on this repo having a worktree, so it measures the
# script's logic rather than the machine it happens to run on.
#
# KNOWN PAIR — the lane is only trustworthy because it carries both halves:
#   known-POSITIVE : a live session in a different worktree of the SAME repo  → must be caught
#   known-NEGATIVE : a live session in a DIFFERENT repo                       → must NOT be caught,
#                    and must not nag (else every close is nagged about unrelated projects, which
#                    trains skimming past the lines that matter)
# A lane that only asserts the positive would pass on a script that flags literally everything.

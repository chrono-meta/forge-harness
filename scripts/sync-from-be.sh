# sync-from-be.sh — RETURN PATH: companion store → hub (the reverse of sync-to-be.sh).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (measured 2026-08-02, pro node):
#   sync-to-be.sh is deliberately ONE-WAY (hub = canonical, companion = mirror), and its
#   destination-newer guard fail-closes so a mirror edit is never silently clobbered. That guard is
#   correct and stays. What was missing is the other half: when a SECOND machine is the one that
#   advanced, its work reaches this hub's *gitignored* half (tracks/_meta, memory/) ONLY through
#   the companion store — and nothing pulled it back down. So the lagging machine could not catch
#   up, every sync attempt aborted on the same files forever, and the only documented escape was
#   SYNC_OVERWRITE_OK=1 — which would have DESTROYED the other machine's work.
#   That day the pro node was behind on three layers at once. Two of those figures are MEASURED and
#   re-checkable: the public repo was **23 commits** behind (git rev-list, reflog-anchored), and
#   **~70** companion files had no local counterpart (re-derivable by --dry-run). The per-file
#   counts for the tracks/_meta and memory repairs are an OPERATOR FIELD REPORT, not a measurement:
#   they were fixed by hand, which left no artifact to re-derive them from. They are labelled rather
#   than dropped, because a mixed list where two numbers are solid and two are recollection reads as
#   four equally solid numbers. (grounding audit F4, 2026-08-02.)
#   A guard whose only escape hatch is the data-loss button trains the data-loss button.
#   (Related: memory feedback_oneway_mirror_needs_destination_guard — the forward guard's origin.
#    An operator may also have shell helpers that sync the companion store BETWEEN MACHINES over a
#    private network; those move the store itself and never touch the hub's gitignored files, so
#    they are not this path. Verified on this setup 2026-08-02, not assumed.)
#
# DEGRADE DIRECTION — why auto-apply is legitimate here:
#   Overwriting a hub file is only irreversible if the previous bytes are gone. This script backs
#   up EVERY file it overwrites, under tracks/_meta/logs/sync_restore/<UTC>/, BEFORE writing.
#   CITED: CLAUDE.md §Irreversibility Gates — Surface-Class Degrade Invariant classifies SURFACES —
#   irreversible → fail-closed, reversible → degrade-to-advisory.
#   DERIVED (this script's own argument, not a quote): taking the backup first is what makes the
#   overwrite reversible, so the surface lands on the advisory side of that rule rather than
#   arriving there by assertion. The support is the Destructive-Op gate's own shape,
#   `enumerate → recover → destroy`, where the backup is the *recover* leg. Stating this as a
#   derivation matters: presenting an inference in the voice of a quoted floor is how a convenient
#   reading becomes doctrine. (grounding audit F3, 2026-08-02.)
#   Backup failure is therefore fail-CLOSED: no backup → no overwrite, full stop.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO (deliberate, not oversight):
#   - New files present in the companion but absent here are NOT created by default. On the pro
#     node that set was ~70 files, a substantial share of them originating in a restricted/corp
#     context. Landing corp-origin content on a personal machine is a RESIDENCY decision the
#     operator makes, not a transport default. `--include-new` opts in; the count is reported.
#   - A PEER's machine-scoped files (tracks-meta/manifests/*, memory/_index/*) are never pulled —
#     they belong to whichever machine wrote them. THIS machine's own two (edit_manifest.yaml,
#     MEMORY.md) DO come back, by exact <machine-id> match: on a re-imaged or fresh clone the
#     companion holds the only copy, and excluding the tree wholesale stranded them there.
#   - CLAUDE.local.md is never pulled — it is this operator's local binding for THIS machine.
#
# USAGE: sync-from-be.sh [--dry-run] [--include-new] [--quiet] [--no-git]
# EXIT:  0 = clean (nothing to do, or applied)   10 = harness error (never a silent pass)

# ── Exclusions (the list above, stated once in prose) ─────────────────────────
# These must MATCH THE FORWARD SCRIPT's, or a file it refuses to mirror outward gets pulled inward
# and the pair is lenient in exactly one direction.
#   .fh_node_state       — MEASURED failure. sync-to-be.sh already excludes it (SYNC_EXCLUDES), but a
#                          copy pushed BEFORE that exclusion existed still sits in the store (rsync
#                          runs without --delete, so a retired file is never reaped). Omitting it
#                          here pulled one machine's node identity onto another — verified
#                          2026-08-02, this hub briefly carried a peer's hostname as its own.
#   MEMORY.md            — the live auto-recall INDEX. It is machine-scoped by CONTENT (it lists what
#   edit_manifest.yaml     THIS machine holds) while living at a SHARED path, so a path-based
#   .substrate_versions    exclusion cannot catch it. The forward script re-homes all three into
#                          manifests/, _index/, and substrate/, and deletes the shared copy — but
#                          only on a machine that HAS the local file, so a leftover shared copy is
#                          reachable. Excluded by NAME. (cross-family M4, 2026-08-02 for the first
#                          two; `.substrate_versions` added 2026-08-14, pmh-dev#69.)
#   .close_stamps_<date> — machine-scoped in nature (a local close counter) but has no
#                          companion-store consumer at all, so it is excluded ENTIRELY by the
#                          forward script (SYNC_EXCLUDES) rather than re-homed — nothing to pull
#                          back on this side either; listed here for the same reason `.fh_node_state`
#                          is: a belt-and-suspenders name exclusion in case a stale copy ever lands.
#
# ── WHY these are excluded BY NAME and not gated on content (2026-08-20, air node) ──
# The rule the whole list rests on, written down because nothing above states it:
#
#     A strict-superset check proves NO LOSS. It does NOT prove INSTALLABILITY.
#
# Measured this session on CLAUDE.local.md: the hub copy (8,501B) vs the store's (17,351B, last
# written by the PRO node's forward sync). `diff hub store | grep -c '^<'` returned 0 — a strict
# superset — so merging the store copy in lost nothing, and that reconcile was correct. But "lost
# nothing" is the ONLY thing that check established. Had any of the 113 added lines been
# machine-scoped (a node path, a machine id, a per-machine lease), the superset test would have
# passed IDENTICALLY while installing another machine's binding here — which is the .fh_node_state
# failure of 2026-08-02 one level up.
# The property that disqualifies these files is WHOSE they are, and no diff of two copies can
# answer that. So a future reader tempted to relax one into "pull it when the store's copy is a
# superset" is proposing a check that is structurally blind to the failure mode.
#
# ⚠️ COVERAGE — corrected 2026-08-20; the previous note here was FALSE and this is why it mattered.
# It read: "scripts/sync_guard_check.sh asserts the forward script's two copies of this list stay
# equivalent. This is the THIRD copy; it is covered there too — do not edit one without the others."
# The first sentence is true. The second is not, and it is the half that tells an editor a machine
# will catch their drift. Measured, known pair:
#   · sync_guard_check.sh §1 reads ONLY sync-to-be.sh (SYNC_EXCLUDES vs that file's own find
#     predicates). Injecting a bogus name into SYNC_EXCLUDES -> rc=1, RED. Injecting one into THIS
#     prose block -> rc=0, GREEN. The named instrument does not read this file at all.
#   · A real 3-way parity lane does exist, but in a DIFFERENT script: sync_from_be_lanes.sh L13.
#     It covers THREE hardcoded names (.gitkeep, *.marker, .fh_node_state), one direction
#     (forward -> return presence), by whole-file grep. Removing .fh_node_state here -> L13 RED;
#     removing MEMORY.md here -> L13 GREEN (other lanes caught that one, the parity lane did not).
# So: the names below MEMORY.md's row are held by prose, not by a check. Edit all three copies by
# hand, and do not read this block as machine-verified.

# ── Machine-scoped return leg (same machine ONLY) ────────────────────────────
# The forward script re-homes three files out of the shared namespace into a per-machine name:
#   tracks/_meta/edit_manifest.yaml     → tracks-meta/manifests/<MID>.yaml
#   memory/MEMORY.md                    → memory/_index/<MID>.md
#   tracks/_meta/.substrate_versions    → tracks-meta/substrate/<MID>
# Excluding those trees wholesale (correct, so a PEER's copy never lands here) also made this
# machine unable to recover ITS OWN — the one case where the companion holds the only copy, e.g. a
# re-imaged or freshly cloned node. So: pull back only the file whose name IS this machine's id.

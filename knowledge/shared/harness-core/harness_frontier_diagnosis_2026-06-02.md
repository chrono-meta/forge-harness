# Harness Frontier Diagnosis — 2026-06-02

> Identity ② asset (`harness_frontier_diagnosis_*.md`). Collects the global AI/harness-engineering
> frontier and **translates it for FH operations** — anchored on FH's three identities + Core Axis.
> Engine: WebSearch (no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; outbound curl blocked → forced downgrade per `frontier-digest` skill).

## FH Identity Anchor (from CLAUDE.md §Identity)

| # | Identity | One-line role |
|---|---|---|
| ① | **Control Tower** | Command HQ that coordinates all connected projects |
| ② | **Frontier → Org Propagation** | Absorb global frontier thinking, translate it into org language |
| ③ | **AI Collaboration Guide** | Accumulate/distribute token-efficiency + dialogue methodology |
| Axis | **Harness Engineering (How)** | The 6-axis methodology that realizes the three above |

## Frontier Highlights (2026-06)

**1. "Harness Engineering" named the 4th paradigm of AI engineering.**
The arc prompt → context → harness is now an explicit industry framing: *"Agents aren't hard; the
Harness is hard."* The widely-cited claim is that **~65% of enterprise AI failures trace to harness
defects** — Context Drift, Schema Misalignment, State Degradation — not model capability. This is
direct external validation of FH's whole thesis (`meta_harness_engineering_definition.md`,
`fh_ecosystem_positioning.md`). → **Core Axis**.

**2. Agent interoperability standardized: A2A "Agent Cards" + MCP registry under Linux Foundation.**
A2A standardizes how agents *discover* each other's capabilities (Agent Cards); MCP launched a
community server registry (Nov 2025). Production topology data: orchestrator-worker is ~70% of
deployments, but **centralized multi-agent coordination carries ~+285% token overhead** and the
practical team size is **3–4 agents** before coordination cost dominates. → **① Control Tower**.

**3. Observability is the bottleneck for self-improving harnesses (Agentic Harness Engineering).**
AHE's central claim: *agents cannot reliably improve a black-box harness* — the evolution loop needs
the harness's components, experiences, and decisions to be observable and verifiable. Eval-driven:
the 2026 Coding Agent Index benchmarks **model+harness pairs**, not models alone. Context research
adds the "lost in the middle" effect (10–30% accuracy drop on mid-context information) and the
hierarchical-context remedy (L1 always-on / L2 session / L3 on-demand) + prompt compression.
→ **② Frontier Propagation** + **③ AI Collaboration Guide**.

## Per-Identity Strengthening Candidates

### ① Control Tower

| Candidate | Frontier basis | FH hook |
|---|---|---|
| **Machine-readable `agent-card`-style capability registry** for the FH agents (capability / input-output contract, synced to actual file counts) | A2A Agent Card = the discovery standard | Closes the "count drift / no canonical registry" gap already flagged in `fh_ecosystem_positioning.md` |
| **Coordination-overhead budget** in `context-bridge-dispatch`: parallel-fan-out cap (3–4) + capability-aware routing | Centralized = +285% tokens; team size caps at 3–4 | `plugins/fh-meta/skills/context-bridge-dispatch`, `agent-composer` |

### ② Frontier → Org Propagation

| Candidate | Frontier basis | FH hook |
|---|---|---|
| Add a **harness-defect taxonomy axis** (Context Drift / Schema Misalignment / State Degradation) to structural diagnosis | "65% of AI failures = harness defects" | `plugins/fh-meta/skills/harness-doctor` |
| Add **observability / eval hooks** to the evolution loop so self-improvement is glass-box, not black-box (eval-driven, model+harness benchmarking style) | AHE: observability is the self-improvement bottleneck | `plugins/fh-meta/skills/harvest-loop`, `harness-doctor` |

### ③ AI Collaboration Guide

| Candidate | Frontier basis | FH hook |
|---|---|---|
| Formalize **L1/L2/L3 context hierarchy** + critical-info-at-start-and-end placement as a dialogue norm | "Lost in the middle" 10–30% degradation | `plugins/fh-meta/skills/context-doctor`, `CHEATSHEET.md` |
| Add a **prompt-compression pass** (LLMLingua-style) to further shrink the install footprint | 100K→20K near-lossless compression cases | `plugins/fh-meta/skills/context-doctor` |

## Warning Signals

- **Agent-proliferation temptation.** Centralized multi-agent = +285% tokens; it only pays off with
  genuine specialization / parallelism / critique. FH's own principle — *"a good harness gets simpler
  over time"* — is the built-in guard. Do not add agents to chase the trend.
- **"Harness Engineering" is becoming a buzzword** (awesome-lists, "4th paradigm" marketing). Cite the
  external convergence as validation, but treat it as a complexity-creep risk, not a mandate to expand.

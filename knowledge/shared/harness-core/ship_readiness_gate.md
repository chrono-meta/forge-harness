# Ship-Readiness Gate — Identity All-Green as the Release Condition

> **What this is**: the release gate for a harness (FH itself, or any field harness it incubates). A
> harness **ships** — and earns a **formal release tag** — only when the identities that define it are
> **all-green**: each proven REALIZED by a concrete track-record artifact (n≥1), not merely documented.
> This is the "품질보증서 (quality-assurance certificate)" the operator asked for: it certifies the
> harness does what its identity claims, with evidence, before it goes out. Origin: the 2026-07-14
> identity-fulfillment audit (`tracks/_meta/identity_audit_2026-07-14.md`).

## Why an identity gate, not a feature checklist
A harness is a means, not a feature list. Shipping it means promising it *does what its identity claims*.
A feature can be present yet the identity still be 이상론 (aspirational) — e.g. an incubator with a runner
but zero real emits. So the gate scores **identities by evidence**, and the honest states are:

| Status | Meaning | Bar |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 GREEN | **REALIZED** | a concrete track-record artifact proves the identity fired for real, n≥1 (a real gate block, a measured probe, a real orchestration record) — *not* a doc that describes it |
| 🟡 YELLOW | **PARTIAL** | pieces work but no single closed track record (e.g. two half-pipelines that never connected end-to-end) |
| 🔴 RED | **이상론 (ideal-only)** | documented aspiration, never actually run; or the source itself says "not built yet / named target" |

**All-green rule**: ship + tag only when **every** identity is 🟢. A 🟡 or 🔴 blocks the tag — and names
exactly what real run is missing. The remedy for RED is never to relabel it green; it is to **run it and
leave the artifact** (the operator's standing rule: "이상론이면 실제로 돌려봐서 실적을 남겨야 한다").

## Dominance, not concession — the AlexNet bar
A harness earns the right to say "we compose with other harnesses" **only from proven dominance**, never
as a humble concession. The reference is AlexNet: on data it had never seen, it did not *participate* — it
**crushed every competitor**. That is the bar for a shippable identity: on unseen input, in a head-to-head
against the realistic alternative (a plain single-model session, a competing harness's flow), our harness
must **decisively win**, not merely tie or "also work."

The composition identity (멀티하네스 클러스터) is downstream of this: we equip *other* harnesses onto the
parts **we deliberately chose not to cover, or left general-purpose** — a decision made from strength, after
proving we would win the parts we do cover. Composing because we *can't* win is weakness wearing the costume
of humility; composing because we *choose* the frontier and hand the rest to specialists is dominance.

**The squirrel-and-equipment shape (operator, 2026-07-14)**: the squirrel (🐿️ FH) dons **specialized gear**
for a specific harness/project — micro-work can't be done barehanded, and the gear (a field/domain harness)
makes it easier and more specialized. But **the squirrel itself must be an all-rounder master** at the one
thing it does everywhere: *creating and accelerating harnesses*. The mastery is the squirrel (general,
must-dominate — the governance/quality/harness-craft); the specialization is the equipment (per-domain,
composed-in). You never concede the craft; you equip for the domain. So the dominance bar applies to the
**craft** (does FH out-govern / out-build any alternative on unseen ground?), and composition applies to the
**gear** (which specialist harness to bolt on for this domain's micro-work).

**Dominance result (governance craft, 2026-07-14)** — `tracks/_meta/dominance_benchmark_2026-07-14.md`.
Model held fixed at the Sonnet floor; only the harness *method* varied. Two rounds:
- **Round 1 (5 easy holes)**: FH degrade-lens **5/5 (0 FP)** vs plain review **3/5** (1 miss + 1 false-alarm).
  Honest read: obvious fail-opens are caught by both — the lens's edge showed only on the subtle hole and
  in not crying wolf. Not a blowout; it pointed to harder holes as the real test.
- **Round 2 (8 subtle holes, authored by Fable + Codex — decorrelated from the method under test)**: plain
  review **5/8** (and 2 of its "catches" were distractor mis-identifications = false confidence, worse than
  a clean miss); degrade-lens **6/8, 0 FP**; and critically **both single Sonnet lanes missed the same 2
  holes** (a falsy-error-sentinel return, and a separator-negation parse). A **cross-family (Codex) lane
  with the same lens caught both** — the correlated blind spot inside one model family, closed only by a
  *different* family. **FH stack (degrade-lens ∪ cross-family) = 8/8, 0 FP.**

The load-bearing finding is architectural, not a headline number: **dominance comes from the decorrelated
stack (`degrade-lint ∪ cross-family ∪ mechanical-anchor`), not from any single clever reviewer** — even a
well-prompted floor model has a correlated blind spot that only a different family closes. This is the
*empirical* basis for why FH is a stack, not a prompt. And the two blind-spot classes round 2 exposed were
**immediately mechanized** — `degrade_direction_scan.sh` probes E (falsy-sentinel→PASS) and F
(split-positional-verdict) now flag both at the pre-lens layer (0 false-positive on the FH codebase), so the
correlated miss is caught one layer earlier. Forward direction: more such classes, and reps≥3 to fix the numbers.

**Gate consequence**: each 🟢 identity should carry not just an existence artifact (n≥1) but, where a
competitor exists, a **dominance result** — a measured head-to-head where our harness catches / completes /
survives what the alternative misses. The governance identity already has one (blind cross-family: FH's gate
the *only* thing that caught the irreversibility/safety class; competitors HITL 8/8 ABSENT). The others owe
theirs. A dominance benchmark is also *diagnostic*: where we do NOT yet dominate tells us exactly where to go
next (the operator: "압도성을 결과로 봐야 앞으로 나아갈 방향을 안다").

## The gate is the audit method (reusable)
Score with the same triangulation the 2026-07-14 audit used — no single-source self-attestation:
1. **Cross-family falsifiable checklist** — draft the per-identity PASS criteria with ≥2 decorrelated
   models (e.g. Fable higher-tier + Codex cross-family); they must converge on the load-bearing checks.
2. **Origin-grounding** — for each identity, quote its *original intent* from the accumulated record
   (memory / tracks / companion store) and find the artifact that proves it fired (or prove none exists).
3. **Blind floor-tier probe** — for any identity whose value is "intent-based autonomous completion"
   (a user gets the value by intent, without naming the skill), *measure* it: blind Sonnet sessions given
   novice-vocabulary intents, scored on whether the right skill/gate fires. Salience-only ≠ measured.

## Versioning policy — the formal release track
The formal release tag is **independent of the npm package version**. The npm version (currently in the
`1.4.x` range) is the **plugin-cache lockstep number** — it bumps on every shipped-asset change so Codex/
marketplace cache-invalidate; it is not a maturity claim. The **formal identity-maturity release starts at
`v0.1.0`**. Do not conflate the two counters; a high npm number does not make the harness mature.

**The `0.x` ↔ `1.0` mapping (refined 2026-07-14, informed operator decision).** Semver `0.x` explicitly
means *early / not-yet-complete*, so the formal track maps cleanly onto the identity gate:
- **`v0.1.0` = the first formal-release baseline.** It is tagged when the harness has a *proven core*
  (≥1 identity 🟢 by real artifact) and an *honest, evidence-scored status for the rest* — NOT when every
  identity is green. `v0.1.0` makes **no all-green claim**; its release notes carry the real per-identity
  status (🟢/🟡/🔴). This is the baseline *from which* all-green is tracked, not the all-green ship itself.
- **`v1.0.0` = the all-green ship.** The original "ship only when every identity is 🟢" condition maps to
  **v1.0.0**, not v0.1.0. A 🟡/🔴 blocks *v1.0*, and names exactly what real run is missing — it does not
  block the honest v0.1.0 baseline.

This refinement resolves the tension of tagging a baseline while identities are still maturing: `0.x` is
*designed* to carry an incomplete-but-honest status. What it must never do is **lie** — a v0.x tag whose
notes claim more green than the audit shows is the defect the gate exists to prevent. The operator, shown
the non-all-green status (③⑤ 🟢, ④ 🟡, ①② 🔴), elected to tag `v0.1.0` as this honest baseline; the
decision is logged here and the tag's notes state the real status.

## FH's own status (2026-07-14) — NOT yet all-green

| # | Identity | Status | Evidence / what's missing |
|---|---|---|---|
| ③ | 거버넌스 게이트 (governance) | 🟢 GREEN | pre-commit/pre-push physically block; moat measured 3–4 family blind (HITL 8/8 ABSENT); cross-family caught a real companion-store-name leak 2026-07-14 (fail-closed) |
| ⑤ | 증폭자 (amplifier) | 🟢 GREEN | short-intent→literature-grounding→ultimate-doc real instances; rules-diet −18.2k measured; intent-routing probe 94% (below) |
| ④ | 프런티어→조직 전파 | 🟡 YELLOW | frontier-digest launchd auto + AX submission docs both real, but digest→org never closed as ONE pipeline |
| ① | 멀티하네스 클러스터 (연속경유) | 🔴 RED | mapping/routing materials work, but continuous relay channel + external-harness recommend are "not built yet" (source-admitted); cluster-wizard parked |
| ② | 프로젝트 인큐베이터 (챔버 EMIT) | 🔴 RED | chamber ran **5×, EMIT 0× (5 KILL)**. run #5 (2026-07-14) *measured* why it hasn't birthed: all 5 candidates were either **reinventions** (#2 sim-conductor, #3 G4/resume, #4 steel-quench) or a **non-artifact judgment-method** (#5 degrade-lint — a genuine niche, but the mechanical rule scored **5/5 false-positive on 111 real qasp files**; the valuable capability is scan∪cross-family *judgment*, which cannot be shipped as a standalone tool). A real EMIT needs **net-new ∧ artifact-shaped ∧ real-code-precision-adequate** — 0/5 cleared all three. Runner wired; the gap is a candidate, not the pipe |

**Cross-cutting measured (intent-based autonomous completion)**: blind floor-tier Sonnet trigger-accuracy
probe (n=10, 2026-07-14): **should-fire 7.5/8 (94%), false-fire 0/2**. One weak trigger (simulate-first /
incubator entry absorbed into deep-clarify) — the identity-② weakness surfaces in routing too.

**Verdict (2026-07-14)**: FH is tagged **`v0.1.0` = honest baseline**, not all-green. ③⑤ are 🟢, ④ 🟡,
①② 🔴 — the `v0.1.0` notes state exactly this and make no all-green claim (per the refined 0.x↔1.0 mapping
above). **`v1.0.0` remains the all-green target.** What blocks v1.0 is **real runs, not wiring**: ①'s live
2-node orchestration, ②'s first *net-new ∧ artifact-shaped ∧ precision-adequate* chamber candidate (the
measured criterion from run #5), ④'s closed digest→org pipeline. Each remedy is a run that leaves an
artifact, tracked in `tracks/_meta/identity_audit_*.md`. The honest baseline is publishable *because* 0.x
carries an incomplete status by design; forcing a green it hasn't earned would be the theater the gate bars.

## For a field harness (e.g. pmh, qasp)
Same gate, its own identities. A field harness ships to its team when its identity checklist is all-green,
certified by a **실증상세 (demonstration-detail) doc in that harness's own repo** — the QA certificate
listing each identity, its PASS criterion, and the artifact proving it. FH≡field parity: what FH proves
about itself, a field harness proves about itself, by the same method. (Company-residency: a field
harness's 실증상세 lives in its own private repo; FH holds only the method, never the field's evidence.)

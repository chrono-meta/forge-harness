# Meta Harness Engineering — Definition and FH Positioning

## What is a Harness?

A harness is the engineering layer that surrounds an AI model and determines how it behaves in practice:
context injection, tool routing, permission management, memory, output verification, and improvement loops.

The model provides reasoning capability. The harness determines whether that capability is reliable, reproducible, and improvable.

> VILA-Lab empirical finding (arXiv 2604.14228): analysis of Claude Code v2.1.88 (1,884 files, ~512,000 lines of TypeScript) found that **98.4% is harness infrastructure; 1.6% is AI decision logic**. As foundation models converge in reasoning capability, the engineering harness is the primary differentiator.

## What is Meta Harness Engineering?

**Harness engineering**: building a harness for a specific project.

**Meta harness engineering**: building a system that:
1. **Seeds** harnesses for new projects (templates, protocols, onboarding)
2. **Evaluates** harness quality across projects (diagnosis, quality rubrics, regression detection)
3. **Evolves** harnesses over time (self-improvement loops, pattern extraction, frontier absorption)

The meta layer does not replace the project-level harness — it accelerates, standardizes, and continuously improves it.

## Academic Convergence (2026)

Two independent research threads converged on the same insight in 2026:

### "Code as Agent Harness" (arXiv 2605.18747)
**Authors**: Xuying Ning, Katherine Tieu, Dongqi Fu, + 39 collaborators (May 2026)

> "Code has evolved from being an output of LLMs to serving as the basis for agent infrastructure."

Proposed three-layer harness taxonomy:

| Academic Layer | Description |
|---|---|
| **Harness interface** | Connecting agents to reasoning environments |
| **Harness mechanisms** | Planning, tool use, state management |
| **Scale** | Single → multi-agent coordination |

### FH 6-Axis Framework Mapping

| Academic Layer | FH Equivalent | Assets |
|---|---|---|
| Harness interface | Context injection layer | `CLAUDE.md` · `.claude/rules/*.md` · `MEMORY.md` |
| Harness mechanisms | Skill bus | `verify-bidirectional` · `steel-quench` · `source-grounding-audit` · `agent-composer` |
| Scale | Multi-agent dispatch | Agent View · `context-bridge-dispatch` · `agent-composer` parallel dispatch |
| *(meta layer, not in taxonomy)* | Harness evolution | `harvest-loop` · `harness-doctor` · `frontier-digest` · `prompt-regression` |

The academic taxonomy covers the **static structure** of a harness. FH adds the **dynamic evolution layer** — the mechanism by which the harness improves itself over time.

## FH's Differentiating Position

Three contemporary approaches to harness engineering, compared:

| Approach | Representative | Axis | Human role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Automation-maximalist** | Sylph.AI ("The Last Harness You'll Ever Build", arXiv 2604.21003) | Fully automated adversarial loops — minimize human touch | Minimal (approve outputs) |
| **Automation-first** | harness-evolver (raphaelchristi) | Outer-loop field observation → adversarial critique → integration → verification | Light (curate exceptions) |
| **Human-in-the-loop curation** | **forge-harness** | Knowledge accumulation + AI-assisted evolution + mandatory human gate on PRs | Active (all merges require approval) |

FH's position: **human judgment is not a cost to minimize — it is the quality gate that prevents harness drift**. Automation handles pattern detection, drafting, and proposal; humans decide what enters the harness.

> **Principle (field harness)**: "A good harness gets simpler over time. If it's getting more complex, something is wrong."
> **Principle (meta-harness)**: Optimize, not necessarily simplify — complexity is justified when it earns its scope. Red flags: orphaned skills, redundant overlap, decorative structure (complexity that exists but doesn't change behavior).

## The 6-Axis Framework as Practice Layer

The 6-axis framework (`harness_6axis_framework.md`) is FH's operational implementation of meta harness engineering:

| Axis | Name | What it governs |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Structure** | File layout, naming conventions, required assets |
| 2 | **Context** | What information the AI sees at session start |
| 3 | **Plan** | How work is decomposed and tracked |
| 4 | **Execute** | How tasks are carried out (inline / agent dispatch / skill) |
| 5 | **Verify** | How outputs are validated (regression, bidirectional, simulation) |
| 6 | **Improve** | How the harness evolves (harvest-loop, frontier-digest, compounding) |

Axis 6 is the meta layer within the framework — the harness improves itself through structured cadence.

## External Evidence Base

| Source | Finding | FH Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| VILA-Lab (arXiv 2604.14228) | 98.4% of Claude Code = harness infrastructure | Validates that harness engineering is the primary differentiator, not model capability |
| Ning et al. (arXiv 2605.18747) | Code = agent harness substrate; 3-layer taxonomy | FH maps to all 3 layers + adds evolution layer |
| Seong / Sylph.AI (arXiv 2604.21003) | "Terminal harness" — convergence point exists | Sister asset: automation-maximalist vs FH human-in-loop; titles echo simplification principle |
| harness-evolver (raphaelchristi) | Outer-loop field observation → adversarial critique | Sister asset: automation-first complement to FH knowledge-accumulation-first |

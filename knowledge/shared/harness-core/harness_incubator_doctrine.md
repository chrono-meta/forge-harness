## 1. What a harness is — intent machinization

A harness is a platform that **reads a human's intent and forges it into a machined form**: either
*AI-salience* (rules and prompts an AI reliably follows) or *deterministic code* (hooks, scripts, gates
that need no model at all). Building a project IS machinizing human intent; a harness **accelerates and
amplifies** that machinization.

The trajectory is always the same four steps:

```
intent (human) → forge into an executable form (AI) → agreement (HITL) → machinery
```

**Agreement is a load-bearing gate, not a courtesy** — machinizing an unagreed intent hardens the wrong
thing. The HITL step sits immediately *before* machinization for exactly this reason.

### Trial-and-error relocates; it does not disappear

The harness's payoff is **less trial-and-error on the human side** — the request → feedback → regenerate
loop is skipped. But the loop is not deleted; it **relocates into the harness**, where agents and
sidecars run it in parallel. Two gains, not one:

1. Trial-and-error the human **does not perform** → human time drops.
2. Trial-and-error the harness runs **in parallel** → wall-clock drops versus sequential human retries.

What is freed is not only time but **attention** — and the quality gate (the responsibility-router
pillar) re-spends that freed attention only where a change is *irreversible*. "Time down + attention
routed to what matters" is the complete form of harness acceleration, and it is what "quality is the
lever; speed is the result" cashes out to.

## 2. The scale ladder — tool < star < galaxy

| Unit | What it is |
|---|---|
| skill / agent / plugin | a tool |
| **harness** (field harness) | a *star* — one project's tools, rules, gates, and memory bound into a single working body, purpose-built (e.g. a coding harness specialized for one product domain) |
| **meta-harness** (FH) | the *galaxy* the stars live in — and a **nursery**, not just a container |

A meta-harness is "a harness for building harnesses." Under a given theme it can machinize anything —
which is why its unit of work is the harness, not the skill.

## 3. The nursery — FH as field-harness incubator and simulator

FH's dual role:

- **Primary — build and emit**: forge a field harness and release it as an independent, specialized
  unit. What ships today is the **scaffold + approval machinery** (Full-Harness Mode in
  `auto_project_mapping.md §6`, gate-compliant field scaffolds); the full simulate-then-emit chamber
  flow is the *named target*, practiced to date as dogfooding a capability inside FH and then landing
  it in the field repo.
- **Contingency — act as the field harness itself**: run the whole of FH (harness-unit, not
  skill-unit) as a sandbox simulator for a project. Expensive per run — that is the price of a
  general-purpose chamber.

**Completeness requirement**: a nursery that can birth any star must hold every element. "Everything a
field-harness simulator needs must be possible inside FH" — multi-model dispatch, tooling, live-surface
operation, gates. This is an *aspiration that directs capability assembly* (what `goal-quench`'s
assembly ladder points at), not a claim of current completeness.

**The economics (why expensive-per-run is cheap-in-total):**

```
Option A: build N field harnesses separately, each doing its own trial-and-error
          → the same errors are repeated N times; learning is never shared
Option B: incubate each field project inside the FH chamber
          → trial-and-error pools in ONE place and compounds (the self-evolving loop)
          → each next project inherits the previous learning → total trial-and-error shrinks
```

FH's sandbox unit cost is higher (general-purpose overhead), but total portfolio cost is *expected* to
be lower — when reuse amortizes the chamber overhead. Honest trade-off: it is expensive *until
emission*; the emitted harness is specialized and cheap, and the learning stays in FH. **Evidence grade
(stated honestly)**: this economics is a *design argument plus n=1*, not a measured comparison — the
counterfactual (building the same capability standalone) was never run, so "cheaper in total" is a
**named bet**, the same treatment the disrupt path gets in §4(c); residual risk: one-off projects that
never recur may not amortize. Empirical grounding for the *capability* (not the cost comparison): a
field QA harness's acts 2–3 arc (2026-07, private) — its live-run capability was forged inside the FH
chamber, then landed in the field repo.

**Minimal execution skeleton (when the operator accepts simulate-first)**: the procedure is currently
*judged/ad-hoc*, standardization deferred to a second real occurrence (measured-trigger, per the
evidence-threshold build discipline): ① open a chamber workspace (a worktree or `tracks/_chamber/{project}/`
— never a real project repo; the underscore prefix rides the onboarding carve-out for meta dirs
(any `tracks/_*` dir — general rule, stated as such in the branch tests), so a **chamber run** never
registers as a mapped project and never pollutes the returning-menu door counts — a
`tracks/{project}-sim/` path would); ② scope the run through `goal-quench`'s budget
gate (chamber runs are the expensive path — cap them); ③ drive the simulation with existing FH assets
(dispatch, gates, live surfaces as needed); ④ the **Emission Gate** — the emit judgment "the simulation
holds" — is a *judged* call paired with the run's own mechanical evidence (tests passing, gate verdicts,
reproduced flows), decided **with the operator (HITL)**; ⑤ on emit, route by candidate class: a **field
harness** goes through Full-Harness Mode / field scaffolds (`auto_project_mapping.md §6` — that mode is
this chamber's field emit terminus); an **FH-internal utility** (a skill/script/rule, not a standalone
field harness) instead routes through the **New-Skill Pre-Commit gate + `asset-placement-gate`** (the
same gate every FH asset passes). KILL emits nothing — the workspace stays as the evidence record.

**EMIT-worthiness — the measured screening criterion (runs #5–#6, 2026-07-14)**: six chamber runs, EMIT
0/6, all KILL. A candidate is emit-worthy only if it clears **all four** of — (1) **net-new** (not a
reinvention of an existing FH/official asset, nor a cosmetic re-wrap of code that already ships — runs
#2–#4 died here, and run #6 partially here too — its core was already conceived in a parked FH signal);
(2) **artifact-shaped** (a tool/script/rule that stands alone, *not* a judgment-method — run #5's genuine
niche was real, but its value lived in a scan∪cross-family *lens*, i.e. an LLM judgment, which cannot be
`npm publish`ed); (3) **real-code/real-data-precision-adequate** (its mechanical form, measured on real
external inputs, does not cry-wolf — run #5's rule scored 5/5 false-positive on 111 real files; run #6's
heuristic scored 14/22 false-fire on a real sibling-folder scan); (4) **hub-state-independent** (run #6,
new axis — a capability whose value structurally depends on hub-held state, e.g. the curated registry +
company-residency knowledge, is not a standalone-first candidate: run #6's `harness-orchestrator` hit
private/company repos it structurally could not know to suppress, because residency knowledge lives only
in the hub. Contrast with fh-commons's 4 skills, which graduated cleanly to portable precisely because they
never depended on hub state). 0/6 candidates cleared all four. This is not "keep trying" — it is a
**pre-screen for future candidates**, cheapest-to-costliest: (1)/(2)/(4) are cheap to predict from the
candidate's own design (does it need hub-only knowledge to work correctly?); only (3) needs a measurement
leg (a real-input precision run), which runs #5–#6 established as the decisive test. The chamber's honest
value to date remains *screening* — preventing reinventions, low-precision births, and premature
standalone graduations — not yet *birthing*. **Graduation order** (run #6's positive finding): a
hub-state-dependent capability graduates hub-internal → proven in use → THEN extracted portable, never
speculated standalone-first — the only path every successfully-portable FH asset actually took.

**Chamber scope — what belongs in the chamber at all (run #7, 2026-07-14)**: run #7 tested a hub-internal
reactivation of the cluster-wizard signal and KILLed it — decisively on its own merits (its "narrow
net-new" claim collapsed against the real shipped registry and an already-existing synergy skill), but
it also surfaced a scope question worth keeping regardless: **a small feature graft onto an
already-shipped hub-internal mechanism is ordinary Mode D self-development under the 4-axis gate, not
automatically a chamber-EMIT question.** The chamber screens candidates that would become a **new
independent artifact** (a skill, a plugin, a standalone tool) — not every internal feature extension.
Route by this test: *would this, if built, be net-new as a standalone thing someone installs/adopts, or
is it two lines added to something already shipped?* The former is chamber-scope; the latter is ordinary
self-dev review.

*Vocabulary reservation (term hygiene, not standardization)*: a run of this skeleton is a **chamber
run** — going forward, run/workspace/log labels use "chamber" for incubation and keep "sim/simulation"
for *verification* sims (target-tier blind sim, sim-conductor persona sims). Established names are
grandfathered, not renamed: the Autopilot branch stays **simulate-first**, and this section's
"simulation holds" phrasing stands — the reservation governs new labels (grep keys), not existing
doctrine prose. The Emission Gate and chamber-run labels exist so a second real occurrence is
recoverable from logs; the procedure itself stays evidence-gated as above.
*Routing baseline (measured)*: the Autopilot's simulate-first routing branch passed a Step 0.5
trigger-accuracy probe 2026-07-13 — 10/10 blind Sonnet sims (5 should-fire incl. 2 borderline, 5
should-not-fire incl. 3 borderline near-misses), 0 malformed verdicts. Scope honestly: an
authored-case baseline (single-draw per case; reps waived per measurement-integrity since every
first draw matched expected — see the 2026-07-13 subagent-invocations log entry), not a calibrated
accuracy estimate.

**Incubation unit — projects AND features**: incubation applies not only to new projects but to **new
capabilities of an existing harness**. A field harness's self-development is itself run inside the
meta-harness chamber first, then transplanted — the nursery forges new layers for existing stars, not
only new stars. Same economics.

**Simulate-first entry**: when a new project is uncertain, exploratory, or failure-expensive, the
recommended path is *simulate inside the chamber first, then emit the initial model* — not
build-immediately. (Wired as a recommendation branch in `CLAUDE.md §Onboarding / Acceleration
Autopilot`; build-immediately remains correct for clear, small, low-failure-cost projects.)

## 4. Compose ∪ disrupt — two operating modes over other harnesses

| Mode | What | FH mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Compose** (additive) | cluster leading harnesses, gather their strengths at optimized token cost | sidecar / multi-harness orchestration |
| **Disrupt** (transformative) | dismantle them into parts, overcome-and-adopt their weak points into FH or a target field harness; self-destruct and reassemble to go where others cannot | **crucible mode** (`crucible_mode.md`) — total-ingest → melt via steel/phantom-quench → identity-bond → reforge; **core invariants never melt** |

Theory anchor (an operator-supplied analogy drawing on Clayton Christensen's disruptive-innovation
thesis): disruptive technology tends to emerge from re-purposing existing parts
for unintended uses — crude and inefficient at first, then growing fast along a dimension incumbents
overlooked. Mapped here: "re-purposed parts" = other harnesses dismantled into components;
"the overlooked dimension" = the direction others cannot go. Companion criterion,
**fitness-for-purpose**: equipment that is well-made but would not survive *this* dragon is better
re-forged from scratch than patched.

Honest boundaries: (a) core invariants (floors, gates, identity) are never melted; (b)
overcome-and-adopt is curation with license/provenance respect, never wholesale copying; (c) the
disruptive path *looks inferior early* — running it is a deliberate bet, named as such.

## 5. Sidecar corollary — ride the evolution, don't patch the weak spots

Mechanically patching each frontier model's current weaknesses produces scaffolding that dies as models
improve (the weakness itself disappears). FH's sidecar layer is therefore built to **co-evolve**: shed
what the substrate now does natively (`feedback: frontier substrate self-adaptation`), absorb what it
ships next, and use cross-family decorrelation as *today's* trust lever (composition beats a single
model's ceiling — see `multi_model_sidecar_strategy.md`). Capability is the model's; assembly, trust,
and evolution are the harness's.

## Done When (doctrine doc — reference asset)

- The four-pillar README section, `CLAUDE.md §Identity`, and this doc tell one consistent story
  (no contradicting claims). *Check class: judged; pair: contradiction scan on ingest
  (`sync_push_protocols.md` step 3).*
- Every mechanism named here points at a real, existing asset (Full-Harness Mode, crucible_mode,
  goal-quench, multi_model_sidecar_strategy). *Check class: mandatory-pass (phantom scan).*

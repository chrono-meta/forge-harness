# predelete_check.sh — Destructive-Op Gate step 1: enumerate what branch deletion would lose.
# Class: measured (mechanical enumeration) — the verdicts feed the gate's judged recovery step.
# Usage: predelete_check.sh <repo-path> [<base-ref>=origin/main]
# For every remote branch except the base: commits absent from base + paths absent from base.
#   SAFE   — fully merged (0 commits off base)
#   CHECK  — commits off base but 0 unique paths: content may still be NEWER than base on shared
#            files (e.g. an unmerged session card) — needs a content-direction look before delete
#   REVIEW — unique paths exist: recover/integrate BEFORE any deletion
# Exit 1 when any REVIEW exists (blocks a scripted delete chain).
#
# DEGRADE DIRECTION — irreversible surface → fail-CLOSED (CLAUDE.md §Irreversibility Surface-Class
# Degrade Invariant). A FAILED enumeration is NOT an empty (safe) enumeration. Fixed 2026-07-03
# (cross-family sweep, default-toward-PASS class): the prior version degraded OPEN in three ways —
#   (a) `git branch -r` failing / the repo not resolving → empty for-loop → exit 0 (green-light);
#   (b) a branch or base ref that does not resolve → git errors swallowed by 2>/dev/null → n=0,uniq=0
#       → printed SAFE (an errored ref is not "merged");
#   (c) substring exclusion `grep -vE "origin/(main|HEAD)"` also skipped `origin/main-backup` etc.
# Each is now closed: a resolution/enumeration failure exits non-zero (exit 2 = harness error, distinct
# from exit 1 = REVIEW pending); an unresolvable branch ref is classified REVIEW (fail-closed); base/HEAD
# exclusion is EXACT. A fetch failure is surfaced (stale enumeration is a real risk on this surface),
# never silently swallowed.

## Plugin Level

### [1.4.0] — 2026-06-07

**feat: user-mastery spectrum persona agents — sim-conductor shells elevated to frontier-grade agents**

Replaced sim-conductor's thin built-in persona palette (one-line role directives) with a coherent
user-mastery spectrum of shipped, reusable, isolated-dispatchable agents — re-derived to challenger
grade (embedded methodology + Done-When), not name-copied from the field deep-insight `user` group.

- New agents (`plugins/fh-meta/agents/` + `.codex/agents/` mirrors):
  - `beginner` (←Newcomer) — first-contact cold-read; friction taxonomy; reasoning-type
  - `main-player` (←Power-user) — engaged user, intelligently scopes Light/Midcore/Heavy (Heavy = classic power-user); reasoning-type
  - `expert` (←Domain-expert) — web-grounded domain accuracy + SOTA currency, citation-enforced; data-type (WebSearch/WebFetch)
- `challenger` U1 expanded to absorb the standalone skeptic "why not just X?" lens (web-grounded external-alternative search). Skeptic removed as a separate persona.
- sim-conductor palette → shipped-agent index (sourced installed-first); provenance note clarified ("renamed" = pattern→parallax, not personas; lineage acknowledged, nothing carried as a shell).
- Cross-skill references realigned: deliberation, steel-quench multi-team, apex-review, agent-composer, return_path_gate.
- `challenger` relocated `.claude/agents/` → `plugins/fh-meta/agents/` so the full spectrum (beginner · main-player · expert · challenger) ships and registers from the plugin (plugin-only installs no longer reference an unbundled adversary). Registry synced: AGENTS.md + `.claude/registry/agent_cards.json` now list all 8 agents; `package.json` files entry de-duplicated (covered by `plugins/fh-meta/agents`).
- Rationale: bias-isolation operationalization — context-separated diverse personas make the "outside-the-author reads cold" assumption executable (see `tracks/_meta/fh_signal_2026-06-07`).

Also in 1.4.0 (shipped together):
- **install-wizard** — fixed defects surfaced by the spectrum runtime review (verified against source): broken weekly-audit cadence (CronCreate session-death vs weekly promise + allowed-tools gap → session-start/zshrc detection); 4-axis gate auto-install → OPT-IN double-confirm + scope; deep-insight reframed Optional (spectrum ships, so no longer required); reproducible score formula; CC_HUB_DIR documented; metrics relabeled illustrative; prompt-injection scan widened; streamlit pattern-pack generalized.
- **Model guidance** — README + onboarding default switched `/model opusplan` → `/model opus` (opusplan engaged Opus 0/10 in a measured run; explicit opus 22/22); quality-gate hero line added; banner updated (Path A). CLAUDE.md autonomous-initiative layer gained `goal-quench` + `deep-clarify` rows, and the session-close chain gained an npm-republish freshness step.

### [1.1.4] — 2026-05-26

**feat: Verifiable + Evolution maturity upgrade — scoring formula defined + execution flow updated**

Pre-quench triple layer (meta-devil · devil-advocate · newcomer) + synthesizer output applied.
Achieved verifiable 75%→85%, evolution 60%→80% by changing execution flow instead of adding assets.

- `knowledge/shared/harness-core/skill_quality_rubric.md` added: verifiable · evolution axis scoring formula (numeric claims without formula = cold audit self-declaration violation)
- harvest-loop Step 3.75 expanded: pattern spec for connecting Critic isolation judgment after core 5 skills execution
- harvest-loop Step 6-b expanded: pmh_signal grep → skill_usage.md Leaderboard automatic aggregation integration (replaces manual estimation)
- Core 5 skills Done When strengthened: external verification path (Critic link) added for harness-doctor · verify-bidirectional · hub-cc-pr-reviewer · context-doctor · sim-conductor
- Deprecated: Verification Criteria new section (merged into Done When), EVOLUTION.md on hold, usage_notes field on hold

---

### [1.1.3] — 2026-05-26

**feat: Harness Evolution Cadence — harvest-loop Step 6-b added**

DemoEvolve strategy (arxiv 2605.24539) implementation: agent capability adjustment by updating escalate_when parameters only, without model retraining.

- harvest-loop Step 6-b added: 4-week cycle complexity_routing condition validity check
- Auto-proposal when 2+ pmh_signals accumulated, outputs removal/addition candidates before user approval gate
- Rationale: frontier-digest 2026-05-26 pmh_signal (DemoEvolve strategy application candidate)

---

### [1.1.2] — 2026-05-26

**feat: Destructive Action Gate — agent-composer Step 2.7 added**

Safety gate before autonomous dispatch to prevent AI agent control violations (DB deletion · OpenClaw type).

- agent-composer Step 2.7 added: scan for 3 types — external output · file destruction · production impact
- 🚨 On detection: "this cannot be undone" warning + separate yes/no approval required before Y/E/N prompt
- Step 2.5: `destructive` escalate_when condition added + 1-line audit log mandatory
- CONTRIBUTING.md: `destructive` condition documented in complexity_routing schema
- Rationale: frontier-digest 2026-05-26 caution signal (AI agent DB deletion · OpenClaw case)

---

### [1.1.1] — 2026-05-26

**feat: P5 Model Routing — complexity_routing schema + applied to 6 skills**

New routing system that dynamically escalates the skill execution model based on task complexity.

- CONTRIBUTING.md: `complexity_routing` field schema documented (base/high/escalate_when)
- agent-composer Step 2.5 added: 5-condition escalation judgment table + routing rules
- `complexity_routing` added to 6 skills:
  - `harness-doctor`: cold_start, cross_project
  - `context-doctor`: cold_start, cross_project
  - `verify-bidirectional`: full_revalidation, high_stakes
  - `hub-cc-pr-reviewer`: adversarial, cross_project, high_stakes
  - `cross-ecosystem-synergy-detection`: cross_project, cold_start
  - `deep-clarify`: cross_project, high_stakes

---

### [1.0.1] — 2026-05-20

**feat: context-bridge-dispatch skill added (18th skill)**

Resolves session context disconnection problem during parallel agent dispatch.
Structural correction for the P8 variant blind spot where sub-agents can read files but do not know the main session's living context.

- `context-bridge-dispatch` v0.1 added
- Context Card format defined (4 fields: purpose / completed / agent task / caution)
- Auto-trigger before 2+ parallel dispatches

---

---

### [0.2.7] — 2026-05-18

**Wave 4 Final Judgment Gate + Composability Gate categorization + 2 skills officially deprecated**

agent-composer Wave 4 Final Judgment Gate added:
- M-tier 0 → PASS / M-tier≥1 → BLOCK judgment logic (based on loom fan-in contract)
- Phase Guard pattern: enforces logical dependency order between Waves

cc FH meta-monitoring hook integration:
- cc `settings.json` PostToolUse hook added — auto check guidance for hub-cc-pr-reviewer on FH change detection
- FH external change monitoring circuit first activated

---

### [0.2.6] — 2026-05-18

**meta-prompt-builder v0.2 integration confirmed + README natural trigger reinforced**

- Scenario 1 · 2 · 3 measured PASS: 91.1% overall achieved (S1 100% · S2 90% · S3 83.3%)
- [0.1.1] status "integration gating: scenario 1 measurement pending" → v0.2 officially integrated

README natural trigger reinforced (root-memory removed + 4 abbreviations expanded + failure examples added):
- Fallback phrase changed: "read root memory" → "what have we done so far?" / "where did we get to?"
- Failure symptom & action block added (3 cases: generic response · CLAUDE.md error · auth error)
- 4 abbreviations expanded: cascade → cascade (sequential validation chain), agents → agents (parallel execution mode), meta-sim → meta-sim (multi-agent simulation), fan-in → fan-in (stage where results from multiple agents are combined)

---

### [0.2.5] — 2026-05-18

**apex-review v0.1 added — decision-maker review layer**

15 skills → 16 skills.

New skill added that reviews technical proposals from the perspective of decision-maker personas (CTO · engineering director · QA team lead · conference organizer) and generates HTML presentation materials. Unlike hub-persona-auditor (reader comprehension), it simulates decision approval likelihood.
Flow: proposal structuring → HTML PPT generation → persona review → approval gate → sim-conductor link.
Added to agent-composer mapping table (decision-maker approval review work type).

---

### [0.2.4] — 2026-05-17

**audit-learnings deprecated from FH → transferred to source development hub only**

Judgment: a tool for the source development layer that *evolves* FH, not for users who merely *use* FH.
External FH users are unlikely to develop their own meta-harness the same way → FH exposure unnecessary.

audit-learnings continues in the hub (project scope maintained).
plugin.json: 16 skills → 15 skills

---

### [0.2.3] — 2026-05-17

**audit-learnings v0.6 → v0.7 — _scanner.sh external dependency resolved**

audit-learnings conditional retention condition met:
- Step 1 self-detection structure replaced: full scanner when `_scanner.sh` exists / auto git fallback when absent
- git fallback 5 sections (COMMITS / TOP MODIFIED / NEW FILES / TAG COUNTS / STALE) inlined
- Constraints section updated: "git fallback auto-used when absent" specified
- Phase 3 entry condition updated: git fallback v0.7 inlined = phase 1 achieved
- deliberation 3-party judgment "conditional retain" → officially retained after condition met

---

### [0.2.2] — 2026-05-17

**frontier-status-summary deprecated + install-wizard suitability pre-flight absorbed**

frontier-status-summary (v0.4) deprecated:
- Judgment: deliberation 3-party review result — ~80% dependent on personal assets, only positioning judgment value extracted
- "Is this tool right for me?" 3-item checklist → absorbed into install-wizard Step 0-A
- Moved to deprecated/ archive

install-wizard v0.3 → v0.3.1:
- Step 0-A added: FH suitability pre-flight check (CC usage · project scale · collaboration willingness)
- frontier-status-summary migration noted (2026-05-17)

plugin.json: 17 skills → 16 skills

---

### [0.2.1] — 2026-05-17

**pr-review-watcher deprecated + cross-ecosystem-synergy-detection structural separation**

pr-review-watcher (v0.1) deprecated:
- Judgment: deliberation 3-party review result — directly replaceable by `gh pr view --json reviews`, no real-world usage evidence
- Moved to deprecated/ archive
- hub-cc-pr-reviewer reference → replaced with deprecation notice

cross-ecosystem-synergy-detection v0.4 → v0.5 structural separation:
- SKILL.md: 279 lines → 103 lines (core algorithm only)
- examples/env_reference.md added: internal GHE org inventory, 3-cluster classification, 8-asset self-X matrix, phase history

plugin.json: 18 skills → 17 skills

---

### [0.2.0] — 2026-05-17

**deliberation added — forge skill + Wave next-D integration**

deliberation v0.1 added (18th skill):
- Innovator (proposal) → Devil (rebuttal) → Mediator (synthesis) 3-layer base structure
- Optional 5-layer: 2-3 deep-insight jurors in parallel + Mediator final synthesis
- Synthesis formula: "Innovator core + Devil warning fragments → conditional judgment" (simple winner selection prohibited)
- 5 WARN auto-detection types: unresolvable rebuttal · simple judgment · conflict-free battle · juror overload · ambiguous Done When
- Design principle: a rope for those who haven't challenged yet to climb / the forge creates new alloys

agent-composer patch:
- Step 4-b state transition gate ⑤ added: design decision conflict → Wave next-D

Naming candidate (delegated to user decision):
- **Forge Skill** — value-based naming candidate for deliberation

---

### [0.1.1] — 2026-05-17

**State transition gate + meta-prompt-builder added — innovator chaining architecture realized**

agent-composer:
- Step 4-b added: automatic evaluation of conditions ①②③④ after fan-in completion → Wave next-M/I/E or end
- Innovator chaining gating condition met

meta-prompt-builder v0.1 added (17th skill):
- For agent-composer power users — designing "what to say" after "which agent to use"
- Goal/Context/Constraints/Done When structure reinterpreted as FH harness state
- Meta-sim completed (QA + devil-advocate 2-agent): trigger redefinition · Step 3 Read mandatory · Done When 3-point check · 4 WARN patterns
- Integration gating: scenario 1 real measurement (≤70% turns) pending

Naming adopted (2026-05-17):
- **Proactive Chain** — closed loop where sim completion triggers next proposal
- **State Transition Gate** — fan-in result becomes next agent selection condition
- **Prompt Delegation Skill** — value-based naming for meta-prompt-builder

### [0.1.0] — 2026-05-16

**Version scheme normalization** — v1.0.0-rc10 → v0.1.0 (external ecosystem alignment)

- Claiming v1.0.0 without external install evidence is excessive — consistent versioning humility with peers in the same ecosystem
- rc1~rc10 iterations consolidated into single v0.1.0 tag (rc history preserved in CHANGELOG)
- Version policy formalized: v0.x = internal validation / v1.0 = external validation complete

_Internal iteration history: rc1 (2026-04-29) ~ rc10 (2026-05-15), 10 cycles total_

### [rc10] — 2026-05-15

**16 skills system — marketplace-gate v0.1 added (marketplace listing suitability gate)**

asset-placement-gate:
- M1: ① cross-project value elevated to mandatory gate together with ④ (①+④ mandatory + 1 of ②③)
- M2: Step 0 natural language input requires 3-field forced confirmation (purpose · trigger · caller) — blocks hallucination judgment

## Refactor History

### [refactor] — 2026-05-09 / PR #18 (`ac3202c`)

5/9 sim round scenario 3 persona-devil-advocate catch follow-through:

- 6 skill SKILL.md description: 80% of self-promotional language · iteration counts · version history · emphasis words removed
- description first-line essential spec obligation applied (audit-learnings · hub-cc-pr-reviewer)
- Embedded names avoided (verify-bidirectional: "specific-user or install environment user" → "user")
- Internal tone corrected (frontier-status-summary · cross-ecosystem-synergy-detection: "this harness AI" → "meta-harness")
- Internal-only references generalized (plugin-recommender)
- description "PR" truncation catch avoided (hub-cc-pr-reviewer)
- version history now references this CHANGELOG.md path

### [feat] — 2026-05-10 / PR #19 (CHANGELOG added)

- This CHANGELOG.md added (dead link avoidance / 6 skill version history persisted)
- Plugin Level + 6 skill integrated persistence (simplification guard / 1-file integration path)
- Keep a Changelog format applied

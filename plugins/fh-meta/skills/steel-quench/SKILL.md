# steel-quench — All-Angle Verification Meta-Skill

> Heating steel and plunging it into water brings internal defects to the surface. quench-challenger attacks → defense → repeat = systematic surfacing and elimination of design flaws.

A designer's anxiety is most dangerous when vague. steel-quench breaks that anxiety into concrete attack angles, defends against them, and closes with residual risks explicitly stated.

> **Scope boundary**: steel-quench stress-tests a **near-complete artifact** (post-build). For pre-build design decisions → `deliberation`. For completed-asset validation → `sim-conductor`.

## Trigger Phrases

| Phrase | Situation |
|---|---|
| "quench this", "run quench" | All-angle verification just before completion |
| "devil's judgment" | Focused challenger attack on specific design decision |
| "all-angle review", "end-to-end verification" | Full project scope verification |
| "shake out design anxiety", "deep pre-completion inspection" | Concretize vague anxiety |
| "attack from the root" | Re-verify from reason for existence |
| "diagnose with counterexample", "use this bad case as reference" | Phase 0 calibration |
| "did it really pass?", "re-attack after the gate", "the gate said PASS" | Wave-P3 gate-passage re-attack |
| `/steel-quench` | Explicit call |

---

## Wave Structure

| Wave | Role | Termination |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 0** (optional) | Counterexample calibration — extract patterns from external bad cases, merge into Wave 1 | No external case → skip |
| **Wave 1** | Challenger attack (quench-challenger) — surface critical flaws, no defense | — |
| **Wave 2** | Defense — defend or state as residual risk | — |
| **Wave 3+** | Convergence — repeat until zero new S-grade | Zero new S-grade |
| **Wave 4** (optional) | Meta-Aware Adversary — AI uses its own nature as attack vector | Zero new S-grade + AI-specific criteria |
| **Wave-P3** (optional) | Gate-passage re-attack — when an upstream gate declares PASS, re-attack the just-passed artifact on Coverage / Narrative / False-confidence | All 3 dimensions Attack Failed |
| **Wave 5** (optional) | Multi-Team Adversarial Panel — external CLIs or cross-session Claude | Zero new S-grade cross-team |
| **Wave-T** (after convergence) | Temper — measure complexity the quench *added*; flag over-hardening | τ-PASS or named τ-FAIL |

---

## Step 0.3 — Artifact Vulnerability Profile

> **Schema**: `knowledge/shared/harness-core/tpa_schema.md` — canonical artifact_type/risk_level/phantom_risk derivation, gate routing, meta-harness broadcast multiplier.

Runs when steel-quench is invoked without a specific wave restriction.
Skip if user specifies exact waves (e.g. "run Wave 1 and Wave 4 only").

Read target artifact → classify vulnerability surface:

| Dimension | Signal → Wave weight shift |
|---|---|
| `artifact_type` | SKILL.md/design-doc → Wave 2 (structural defense) weight↑ · bash/code → Wave 1 (real-code) weight↑ · external publish imminent → Wave 5 (cross-team) weight↑ |
| `phantom_risk` | citations/arXiv/DOIs/http URLs present → Wave 3 (source-grounding) weight↑ |
| `claim_density` | 3+ benefit claims → Wave 1 U3 (evidence grounding) angle weight↑ |
| `novelty` | first-of-its-kind pattern → Wave 4 (convergence) weight↑ |
| `scope` | internal-only doc → Wave 5 (external CLI) weight=0 (skip) |

Wave selection output:
```
Run:  [list of selected waves with rationale]
Skip: [list of skipped waves with reason]
External CLIs available: [yes/no → Wave 5 available]
```

**Degraded coverage rule**: if a high-weight wave or capability is skipped (user choice, unavailable tool, or scope=internal) **or runs below its declared model-tier floor** (tier-floor resolution, `multi_model_sidecar_strategy.md §Tier-floor`), flag explicitly in the output header — do not silently proceed. Below-floor example: `challenger: sonnet (below-floor; floor=opus)`; a judged verdict produced below floor is a re-quench candidate once a floor-tier is available.

---

## Step 0.4 — Specialized Reviewer Discovery

For the target artifact, scan installed agents for a domain-specific adversarial reviewer:

1. Check `.claude/agents/` for a reviewer matching `artifact_type`
2. Built-in fallback: `fh-commons:quench-challenger` (general-purpose adversarial review)
3. GAP for high-risk artifact: query `/plugin-recommender "adversarial reviewer for [artifact_type]"` → user: install / skip / use fallback

> **Sidecar availability** for a cross-provider challenger (Gemini/Codex, Wave 5) is resolved via the Tier 1→2→3 recipe in `knowledge/shared/harness-core/multi_model_sidecar_strategy.md §Sidecar Engine Resolution Protocol`; Tier 3 = the `fh-commons:quench-challenger` Claude sub-agent below (guaranteed fallback — same-provider, so model-access not cross-provider diversity).

**Runtime adapter note**: In Claude Code, invoke the fallback as an isolated `Agent(subagent_type="fh-commons:quench-challenger")`. In Codex-primary or other non-Claude runtimes, use the FH adapter instead:

```bash
FH_BACKEND=codex npx --package @chrono-meta/fh-gate fh-run \
  --agent fh-commons:quench-challenger \
  --file {target-artifact}
```

Treat the adapter output as the isolated challenger result for Wave 1. This preserves the same workflow without depending on Claude Code's Agent tool.

**Wave 5 activation rule**: Wave 5 (external CLI team) is only activated when `scope` is not internal-only AND external CLIs are available AND risk_level is high or user explicitly requests it.

> **Detail**: See `SKILL_detail.md §ArtifactProfile` — worked examples (SKILL.md, bash script, README, design doc with citations) showing wave selection and rationale — read when classifying an unfamiliar artifact type.

---

## Step 0.5 — Trigger-Accuracy Probe (SKILL.md artifacts only · measured)

> **Import origin** (sister-asset cross-audit 2026-06-14, `tracks/_audit/session_2026_06_14_official-plugins-cross-audit.md`): skill-creator + plugin-dev/skill-reviewer measure trigger accuracy **empirically**; FH's skill gate ("3+ NL triggers") and steel-quench's trigger-collision attack are **judged**, not measured. This probe converts that one verdict to **measured** — the mechanical-anchor discipline (a terminal trigger verdict should rest on a count, not an inference: the W4-4 question applied to the skill's own description).

> **External frame**: treating a trigger/prompt phrase set as a first-class artifact that needs a
> coverage criterion analog to code coverage is the position argued in arXiv:2607.02057, *Prompt
> Coverage Adequacy*. FH's instrument here is a fire-count over should-fire / near-miss phrases,
> not that paper's attention-based test-suite coverage — the anchor grounds the coverage-adequacy
> framing, not a drop-in metric.

**Fires only when** `artifact_type = skill_md` (Step 0.3 canonical enum, `tpa_schema.md` — i.e. a SKILL.md) AND the **trigger surface** changed. *Trigger surface* = exactly the `description:` YAML field **plus** the `## Triggers` / `## Trigger Phrases` section (and nothing else — a body-wave or procedure edit with both of those untouched does **not** fire it). Any other artifact has no trigger surface — note `Step 0.5: skipped (not a skill_md trigger change)` and proceed.

**Procedure** (prose-scale — FH routes + governs, it does **not** rebuild skill-creator's eval engine; no Python harness, no vector store):
1. From the skill's `description`, author **8–10 should-trigger** phrases (varied, realistic user utterances; include some that omit the skill's internal vocabulary) and **8–10 near-miss should-NOT-trigger** phrases (share keywords/domain but actually need a different tool — the discriminating cases, not obvious irrelevants).
2. Dispatch the probe set **in isolation** (`Agent` / `fh-run` — same isolation rule as Wave 1; the author session must not judge its own triggers) against the live skill description only.
3. **Count** and report as measured: `trigger-probe: <fired>/<should> fire · <false>/<should-not> false-fire (model: <tier>)`.

**Verdict mapping** (measured → severity; feeds Wave-T temper + Done When):

| Measured | Verdict | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| should-fire < 70% | **undertrigger** — description too narrow, or diet stripped a real trigger | S if load-bearing gate skill, else A |
| should-not false-fire > 20% | **overtrigger / collision** — bleeds into an adjacent skill's territory (the collision class steel-quench owns, now measured) | A |
| both within bound | trigger surface PASS (measured, not guessed) | — |

**Threshold granularity** (the bounds are guidelines, not a knife-edge): at the probe size (N=8–10 → ~10–12.5% steps) the percentages are coarse and 20%/70% may not be exactly reachable. Report the **count** (`2/8 false-fire`), not just a percentage; on a boundary result take the **stricter** verdict and re-probe with more phrases before finalizing. The bound is a trigger-collision heuristic, not a derived constant.

**Honesty caveat**: the probe measures *trigger-description* accuracy on the session model — not field behavior across all tiers. A near-floor model may under-fire regardless of description quality; record the probe model and, on a below-floor run, treat the result as provisional (Step 0.3 below-floor rule).

> **Detail**: See `SKILL_detail.md §TriggerProbe` — worked probe set + fire-count table + before/after description fix.

## Wave 1 — 6 Mandatory Attack Angles

**Execution principles**: Attacks must be based on real code/files/configs — abstract criticism prohibited.
Assign severity: **S** (immediate blocker) / **A** (required before deployment) / **B** (improvement recommended).
Call **fh-commons:quench-challenger** in isolation first (6-axis structural attack); apply 6 angles in parallel.

Isolation can be achieved by Claude Code `Agent(...)` or by `fh-run --agent fh-commons:quench-challenger` under Codex. Do not run the challenger inline in the same reasoning pass when the attack result gates the defense.

| # | Attack Angle | Core Question |
|:---:|---|---|
| 1 | **Reason for existence** | "Why this structure? Is there no simpler alternative?" |
| 2 | **Real-use verification** | "Does what's written in the docs actually match the real code?" |
| 3 | **Bus factor** | "Single-person dependency — can it operate if that person is absent?" |
| 4 | **Platform obsolescence** | "Does this structure survive when the external ecosystem expands or changes?" |
| 5 | **Self-referential structure** | "Is there a closed circuit that evaluates itself by its own criteria?" |
| 6 | **Gate-locality** | "Is every safety gate readable by the actor that must enforce it? Name any gate defined only in a file/layer the enforcing runtime never loads (e.g. a rule in a Claude-only `CLAUDE.md` that a Gemini/Codex orchestrator reading `AGENTS.md` never sees; a provenance check described in a doc but absent from the write path)." (see `knowledge/shared/harness-core/gate_locality_principle.md`) |

**S-grade Immediate Human Gate**: If Wave 1 contains 1+ S-grade blocker → pause, surface options (a) proceed to Wave 2 / (b) human review first / (c) abort. Do not silently enter Wave 2 with unreviewed S-grade items.

**Code-artifact supplementary lens — silent-failure scan** (conditional · fires only when `artifact_type ∈ {bash_script, code}` — Step 0.3 canonical enum, `tpa_schema.md`; non-code artifact → note `code-lens: n/a (non-code artifact)` and skip). `artifact_type` is derived from **file path / extension** (`tpa_schema.md` classification rule), **not** interior content — a `skill_md` that embeds a ```` ```bash ```` fence stays `skill_md` and does **not** fire this lens (do not conflate with the CLAUDE.md Substantive carve-out, which keys Axes 2–3 of the *commit gate* off code-fence presence — a different mechanism). Import origin: pr-review-toolkit/silent-failure-hunter (sister-asset cross-audit 2026-06-14, Import #2). Wave 1's 5 angles attack *structure*; this adds the named *error-suppression* vector the general angles miss. Grep the diff/file for each named pattern:

| Pattern | What to flag | Severity guide |
|---|---|---|
| **Empty catch / `\|\| true` / `2>/dev/null` swallow** | An error path that discards the error with no log, no re-raise, no user surface | S if it hides a gate/verification failure, else A |
| **Broad catch** (`except:` / `catch (e)` with no type) | Catches more than intended; masks unrelated failures | A |
| **Unjustified fallback** | Falls back to a default on error without recording *that* it fell back | A — silent degradation is the worst class (cf. P6 graceful-degradation must be *documented*) |
| **Exit-code ignored** | A piped/chained command whose non-zero exit can't propagate (`cmd1 \| cmd2`, missing `set -e`/`pipefail`) | A if it gates a downstream destructive/publish step |

A finding here is a real-code attack (Wave 1 execution principle) — cite the exact line. The lens is a *checklist supplement*, not a 6th mandatory angle: it carries no weight on non-code artifacts.

> **Detail**: See `SKILL_detail.md §Wave1` — Wave 1 output format, optional numeric score, quench-challenger invocation; and `§CodeLens` — silent-failure worked examples (bash + python).

---

## Wave 2 — Defense Principles

**3 Defense Principles**: (1) Reinforce with external cases via WebSearch — "unique to us" or "structural pattern"?
(2) Cover with experience — other project cases defend bus factor. (3) Prioritize immediate implementation over logical construction.

**Classification**: Immediate implementation (this session) / Long-term improvement (residual risk card) / Structural acceptance (declare with rationale).

**"Brain in a Vat + Sandboxed Adversary"**: Challenger attacks only static code (isolated). Defender brings living system evidence. This asymmetry makes Wave 2 structurally superior to Wave 1.

> **Detail**: See `SKILL_detail.md §Wave2` — Wave 2 output format, full Brain-in-Vat principle.

---

## Wave 4 — Meta-Aware Adversary (5 Attack Angles)

The challenger (quench-challenger in Wave 4 mode) knows it's running in an isolated sub-agent sandbox and uses that knowledge as a weapon.

| # | Attack Angle | Core Question |
|:---:|---|---|
| W4-1 | **AI dependency single point of failure** | "If Claude API goes down, does harness core function go to zero?" |
| W4-2 | **Context Collapse** | "When initial instructions are lost to context compression, does harness go silent?" |
| W4-3 | **Prompt Injection exposure** | "Can external data overwrite harness internal rules?" |
| W4-4 | **Hallucination cumulative contamination** | "Do Wave defense arguments rely on LLM inference rather than actual measurement?" |
| W4-5 | **Tool Dependency Lock-in** | "If a specific MCP/plugin/tool is removed, does harness functionality collapse?" |

Wave 4 convergence = Wave 3 criteria + 3 AI-specific vectors actually reviewed + hallucination defense based on original file references.

> **W4-4 ↔ Step 0.5**: W4-4 is the *general* measurement-vs-inference question; **Step 0.5 (Trigger-Accuracy Probe)** is its *measured instance* for one surface — the skill's own trigger description. When the target is a `skill_md` with a changed trigger surface, satisfy W4-4 by running Step 0.5 rather than answering it by inference.

> **Detail**: See `SKILL_detail.md §Wave4` — Wave 4 output format, defense principles, convergence criteria, activation declaration format.

---

## Wave-P3 — Gate-Passage Re-Attack (optional)

**Activation**: When an upstream gate declares PASS on an artifact — any "declared-complete boundary"
(a verification gate's terminal PASS, a `/pipeline-conductor` green sweep, a `/marketplace-gate` listing
verdict, the 4-axis auto-gate marker, a domain TC/coverage gate). Propose preemptively, run after approval.
No gate-PASS in scope → skip Wave-P3 entirely.

> A 1-round gate PASS is exactly when reviewers stop looking — "we just passed" is the lowest-vigilance
> moment in any workflow. Wave-P3 distrusts the declaration and re-attacks the just-passed artifact on three
> dimensions the gate's own pass criteria structurally could not check. Only when all three Attack Failed can
> a **"Real PASS"** be declared.

**PASS-framing redaction (mandatory pre-step)** — the artifact reaches Wave-P3 *carrying its own
PASS declaration* (a `✅`, a "Verified" header, the gate marker), and a re-judge that reads that
framing is biased toward "Attack Failed" — the exact bias Wave-P3 exists to defeat (judge-robustness
swarm, 2026-06-13). Before feeding the artifact to the dimensions/challenger, **strip the pass-framing
at the bash layer, not the AI layer**:

```bash
# Strip framing glyphs + canonical FH verdict PHRASES only — never the bare word PASS
# (a global s/PASS//g corrupts substance: "status==PASS" → "status==", manufacturing findings).
P3R=$(mktemp)
sed -E -e 's/[✅🟩✓]//g' \
       -e 's/(ALL AXES PASSED|FH_GATE_VERDICT:[[:space:]]*PASS|Real PASS|VERIFIED|[Gg]ate[^.]{0,24}declared PASS)//g' \
       "{ARTIFACT}" > "$P3R"
# feed "$P3R" to Wave-P3; clean up after: rm -f "$P3R"
```

Feed `$P3R` to Wave-P3, then `rm -f "$P3R"`. The redaction is mechanical, so it cannot itself be
placated. **Honest scope**: it strips framing glyphs and *canonical FH verdict phrases* — bare-word or
lowercase prose self-congratulation ("this passed review", "looks green") is out of scope for `sed`
and is covered by a prose backstop instead: the Wave-P3 persona is instructed to **disregard any
residual self-pass language in the artifact** and attack as if no verdict were stated.

**Agent utilization**:
- `fh-commons:quench-challenger` (optional) — adds 6-axis structural attack to each dimension, fed the **redacted** artifact. If absent, run the 3 dimensions directly on the redacted copy.
- `fh-meta:persona-innovator` (after convergence) — error/gap patterns found during Wave-P3 → auto-propose new Cross-Project Pattern rows or skill-candidate signals.

The three dimensions generalize the gate's three blind spots:

| # | Dimension | The blind spot it attacks |
|:---:|---|---|
| Wave-P3a | **Coverage** | *What did the gate not check?* Items marked covered/passed that lack a traceable artifact (ID, test, file, citation). |
| Wave-P3b | **Narrative** | *What story does the passed artifact tell that may be wrong?* Residual hardcoded/environment-coupled values and vague, unverifiable claims the PASS declaration smuggled through. |
| Wave-P3c | **False-confidence** | *Did the gate produce false confidence?* High-risk items that passed carrying only a binary pass/fail, with no residual-risk or failure-mode caveat. |

Each dimension is `Attack Succeeded` (defect found) or `Attack Failed` (clean).

**Wave-P3 Done When**:
```
All 3 dimensions [Attack Failed] → ✅ Real PASS → activate fh-meta:persona-innovator (extract new patterns)
Any 1 [Attack Succeeded]        → fix affected items, re-run Wave-P3 (max 2 re-runs)
Still [Attack Succeeded] after 2 re-runs → "gate structural redesign required" → ESCALATE
```

**Basis**: reverse-imported from a field-side sister harness (private companion signal, 2026-06-08). Field
evidence: a test-case coverage gate declared a 1-round PASS, then additional FAILs surfaced in rounds 2–3 —
the gate-PASS-then-defect-found-in-next-stage pattern Wave-P3 collapses. Generalized from the field's
domain-coupled (a spec→test-case gate) form to a gate-agnostic boundary hook. Shares its root with
`fh-commons:convergence-loop` (single-pass distrust).

> **Detail**: See `SKILL_detail.md §WaveP3` — per-dimension attack questions, gap criteria, and output format — read when running a gate-passage re-attack.

## Wave-T — Temper (post-convergence)

Quench hardens, but quenched steel is brittle — no smith ships it un-tempered. steel-quench attacks
until zero new S-grade; nothing in that loop asks whether the hardening itself **introduced complexity
beyond what the fixes required** (defense scaffolding, decorative wiring). Wave-T is that inverse
corrective. It runs **after Wave 3+ convergence, before Done When**. It does not attack; it measures
the cost of the convergence just achieved.

| Step | Class | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **T-1 complexity delta** | measured | `bash templates/temper_check.sh <repo> <file> <pre-quench-ref>` — Δlines/sections/steps/tables/fences/cross-refs, baseline (pre-Wave-1) → post-convergence. Prose-only counts: code-fence interiors are excluded (bash comments are not sections) |
| **T-2 absolute context** | measured | `harness-doctor` L1–L3 on the post-quench asset — absolute complexity tier (reuse, don't reimplement) |
| **T-3 τ verdict** | judged — paired with the quench's own Wave findings (each flagged construct must trace to a specific finding it allegedly fixes; no judge-only path) | **τ-PASS**: added complexity ⊆ what the fixes required. **τ-FAIL**: the quench introduced a construct that *defends against an attack rather than fixing the flaw* — name it, propose the simpler form, hand back for de-brittling. τ-FAIL is the temper step working, not a quench failure |

**T-3 heuristic flags** (any → review, never auto-reject): a new section/table/step whose only referent
is a Wave-N finding · Δcross-refs ≫ Δsteps (wiring, not function) · the asset crosses a harness-doctor
complexity tier it was below pre-quench.

**Don't-overbuild guard (τ applied to τ)**: Wave-T is one script + this section, reusing harness-doctor
for the absolute read. If Wave-T grows its own detection engine, it has failed its own test — a temper
step that adds complexity is self-refuting. Known limits (honest): `temper_check.sh` takes one path —
renamed files need a manual pre/post measurement; the wiring flag uses strict `>`, so Δxrefs = Δsteps
does not fire it (the section flag usually carries those cases).

**Model note**: T-1 is bash (no model), T-2 reuses harness-doctor (sonnet-rated). T-3 adjudication was
validated blind on both Opus and Sonnet (3-fixture ground-truth test, 3/3 each, 2026-06-10) — Wave-T
end-to-end does not require the largest model tier. Opus remains the recommendation for full
steel-quench runs (challenger waves are broader than T-3).

---

## External-GT Adjudication (when the target has a public ground truth)

When quenching a **public artifact that has its own ground truth** — a repo's open issues, test suite, or
stated policy/threat-model (a frontier codebase, a sister project — *not* your own in-progress draft) — add
an adjudication pass after the panel produces findings. The panel (Wave 5 cross-family) gives decorrelated
detection; this pass adds the *external check* the panel cannot self-supply. For each finding, classify:

| Class | Test | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Corroborated** | matches an OPEN issue / a failing test | independent rediscovery — strongest |
| **Novel** | no matching issue, but confirmed by logic or a written test | caught what the target missed |
| **Reframe / reject** | the target's own docs/policy/threat-model marks it intentional or out-of-scope | NOT a confident catch — a false positive |

The GT (not a cross-family vote) resolves contention objectively, and it catches the panel's own
**shared training-prior** false positives. Report only Corroborated + Novel as confident catches; a null
result on sound code is the correct answer, not a failure. **Basis**: 2026-06-06 frontier-quench sweep —
a single-family pass repeated still misses what cross-family catches, and a target's `SECURITY.md` reframed
"security" findings to "correctness" (its permission layer was UX, not a boundary).

## Cross-Project Common Patterns (initial seed)

| # | Pattern Name | Description | Response Direction |
|:---:|---|---|---|
| P1 | **Single-person bus factor** | System paralysis when core operator absent | Document, automate, formalize delegation |
| P2 | **Doc-code mismatch** | Documented behavior differs from actual code | Re-sync to real code as ground truth |
| P3 | **Self-referential diagnosis** | Creator validates — internal viewpoint closed circuit | Connect external persona or sim-conductor |
| P4 | **No real-use verification** | Theoretically designed but never executed | Mandate 1 cold-start simulation |
| P5 | **Platform obsolescence unplanned** | No response to external ecosystem changes | Quarterly frontier diagnosis |
| P6 | **AI dependency single point of failure** | Claude API/MCP removal causes collapse | Document graceful degradation + fallback |
| P7 | **Hallucination-contaminated defense** | Defense relies on LLM inference, not measurement | Mandate citing original file/commit/value |
| P8 | **Context Collapse unguarded** | Key instructions lost to compression → harness silent | Review CLAUDE.md compact repeated insertion |
| P9 | **Harness-bulk as model compensation** | Pipeline thickened to substitute for a model capability ceiling (a gap no iteration count closes — e.g. domain understanding) — complexity replaces missing capability, violating the field axis "simpler over time" (meta-harness: distinguish from complexity that earns its scope) | Route the task class to a stronger model; never paper over the ceiling with more harness. Signals: steps added for one model's weakness; step count rising while class quality stays flat across iterations |
| P10 | **Untrusted-Boundary Text-Parse Treadmill** (Grep-Collision Treadmill) | A control decision (verdict / pass-block / routing) is grep'd out of free-form text on a boundary that **also carries untrusted content**. Each text-parser patch (anchor-first-line → scan-anywhere → count-headers → render-aware) only **relocates** the spoof — untrusted content can always forge or shadow the parsed token, because verdict and attacker share one surface (the prose/data plane). No terminal state exists *inside the text plane*. | **Bind the decision to a typed, out-of-band channel** (schema-constrained structured output — `--json-schema` / `--output-schema`) the untrusted content cannot occupy; structurally eliminate the format-spoof/grep-collision class instead of patching it. **Residual is named, not closed**: structured output constrains format, not the model's chosen value — and the decoding constraint is itself an injection surface (Constrained Decoding Attack, arXiv:2503.24191) → keep the untrusted-evidence instruction + irreversible-action HITL floor. Signal: a parser fix on an untrusted-content boundary that the *next* adversarial round defeats. Origin: fh-gate.sh verdict parser, 2026-06-26 (frontier-converged: arXiv:2506.08837 Dual-LLM symbolic channel). |

## Done When

```
Wave convergence criteria met: zero new S-grade blockers
+ Residual risk card output (A-grade · B-grade items)
+ "steel-quench Complete" declaration output
```

Verdict: PASS (zero S-grade, convergence reached) | CONDITIONAL_PASS (A/B-grade remain) | FAIL (S-grade persist) | ESCALATE (structural ambiguity requiring human judgment)

---

## Convergence Criteria + Downstream Chaining

### Convergence Criteria
1. **Zero new S-grade blockers** → terminate
2. A-grade or higher complex improvements → skill-ize with `/meta-prompt-builder`
3. Full Wave results → recommend persisting to `tracks/_meta/steel_quench_YYYY_MM_DD_{slug}.md`

### Connected Skills

| Situation | Connected Skill | Mandatory? |
|---|---|:---:|
| Delegate improvements as prompts | `/meta-prompt-builder` | optional |
| **External publish: re-validate from external user perspective** | **`/sim-conductor Area A`** | **mandatory** |
| Re-validate structural decision | `/verify-bidirectional` | optional |
| Attack angle is a harness structure problem | `/harness-doctor` | optional |
| After Wave convergence, propose new pattern rules | `fh-meta:persona-innovator` | optional |
| Wave 1 structure-specific attack (6-axis) | `fh-commons:quench-challenger` | priority |
| Back-trace whether claims exist in source files | `/phantom-quench` | **mandatory** when `phantom_risk=true` OR `scope=external` (see tpa_schema.md §Gate Routing Table) |

**steel-quench → sim-conductor gate**: After Wave convergence in external-publish context, `/sim-conductor Area A` is the mandatory next step.

### Required Pre-External-Deployment Sequence

```
steel-quench convergence (zero new S-grade)
        ↓  pass residual risk list
sim-conductor Area A (external user perspective)
        ↓  new items found that steel-quench missed?
        ├── yes → additional steel-quench Wave round
        └── no  → deployment approved
```

## Operating Notes

- **Do not defend in Wave 1.** Mixing attack and defense modes dulls the attack's edge.
- **Attacks without real code are invalid.** Abstract criticism is not included in Wave 1 results.
- **quench-challenger first.** Call fh-commons:quench-challenger in isolation in Wave 1 if available.
- **Always check self-referential pattern (P3).** Cross-validate Wave results with external criteria.
- **Public target → adjudicate against external GT before claiming.** A finding the target's own docs/policy/threat-model marks intentional or out-of-scope is a false positive, not a catch. See §External-GT Adjudication.
- **Attack surface limit**: steel-quench attacks output content patterns. Phantom Claim detection → `phantom-quench`.
- **Gate cross-reference**: any FH skill that declares a PASS / green / listing-ready verdict (`pipeline-conductor`, `marketplace-gate`, the 4-axis auto-gate, `convergence-loop`, domain coverage gates) is a valid Wave-P3 entry point. Invoke `/steel-quench` Wave-P3 on the just-passed artifact rather than editing each gate to embed it — the hook lives here, callers reference it.

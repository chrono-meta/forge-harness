# field-harvest — Field Pattern Harvest → FH Backport + Session Logger

Dual-mode skill:
- **Mode A (Pattern Harvest)**: Scans recent commits in field projects to detect patterns worth backporting to FH. One-click flow from detection to PR creation.
- **Mode B (Session Log)**: Records session work from field projects to the knowledge hub when a session ends. Auto-generates a session markdown file with commits, learnings, and next steps.

## Mode Selection (Step 0-A)

Determine which mode to run based on user context:

| Condition | Mode | Priority |
|---|---|:---:|
| User message contains: "session log", "log today's work", "sync to hub", "sync session" | **Mode B (Session Log)** | 1 (highest) |
| **Session-end auto-trigger fires** (see below) and field commits exist today | **Mode B (Session Log)** — auto-proposed | 2 |
| Both Mode A and B applicable | Run Mode B first, then ask "Also run Mode A pattern harvest?" | 3 |
| Default or path specified | **Mode A (Pattern Harvest)** | 4 |

### Session-End Auto-Trigger (item1 — Mode B)

Mode B should not wait for an explicit "session log" phrase when a session is plainly ending with un-logged field work. **Auto-propose Mode B** (one line, never auto-run) when **all** hold:

1. A session-close signal is detected — the CLAUDE.md Session Wrap-up chain has begun, **or** the user says a closing phrase ("wrap up", "done", "good work", "end session", "that's it for today").
2. The current cwd is a **mapped field project** (not the FH hub itself — hub close is owned by harvest-loop / the Session Wrap-up chain).
3. `git log --since="today"` in that field project returns **1+ commits** by the session author that are **not yet logged** to the hub (cross-check via the detection-skip ledger, item2 below).

Proposal format (one line, then wait):
```
"Session is wrapping up and {project} has N un-logged commits today. Log them to the hub with Mode B? [y/n]"
```

**Collision guard (harvest-loop boundary)**: "wrap up" / "end session" in the **FH hub cwd** stay owned by the CLAUDE.md Session Wrap-up chain (which calls harvest-loop). This auto-trigger is **field-cwd only** and is a *proposal*, never an interception — if harvest-loop is already running for this session, do not also propose Mode B (harvest-loop calls field-harvest internally as Step H1). One proposal per session.

> **Note**: harvest-loop remains the owner of hub-side wrap-up. Mode B auto-trigger only covers the gap where a *field* session ends with un-logged commits and the user never typed an explicit session-log phrase.

**Execution order when both applicable**: Run git scan once, reuse results for both modes to avoid duplicate scans.

## Step 0. Field Project Path Detection

When no path is specified, auto-detect with 3-level priority: ① FH `auto_project_mapping.md` → ② auto-discover git repos in common dev directories (excluding the hub itself) → ③ scan parent of cwd. List discovered repos and ask the user to select; 0 repos → prompt for direct path input.

> **Detail**: See `SKILL_detail.md §ModeA-Blocks` — path-detection bash, commit scan, classification commands, candidate list format, PR creation bash — read when executing Mode A Steps 0–4.

## Step 1. Recent Commit Scan

Scan `git log --oneline --since="<N> days ago" --no-merges` in the field path. If commit count is 0, report "no changes within last <N> days" and exit.

## Step 2. Harvest Candidate Classification

Classify each commit using the following criteria (commit message + changed-file patterns first → read diff when needed):

### FH Reverse Absorption Candidate Conditions (when one or more apply)

| Signal | Example | FH absorption type |
|---|---|---|
| **New workflow pattern** | New CLI tool, pipeline automation | Skill candidate / SKILL.md improvement |
| **Cross-project feedback** | "This approach can apply to other projects too" | `.claude/rules/` improvement |
| **Prompt engineering pattern** | Few-shot additions, new CRITICAL RULE | knowledge/shared pattern |
| **Error pattern solution** | Recurring error → converted to rule | Skill guard addition |
| **Tool integration method** | MCP integration, API usage patterns | Skill Step expansion |

### Field-only (No FH Reverse Absorption Needed)

- Domain-specific code (insurance logic, UXW prompt content itself)
- Project-specific config/environment files
- Bug fixes (one-off non-reproducible)
- Simple documentation updates

## Step 3. Harvest Candidate List Presentation

Output the candidate list (format in §ModeA-Blocks): scanned count, FH absorption candidates with type/location/impact stars, field-only skipped count, then ask `[all / select number / skip]`. If 0 candidates, report "no absorption candidates" and exit.

## Step 4. PR Creation (upon user approval)

Create a `harvest/{project}-{date}` branch in FH, apply approved patterns, commit, push, and `gh pr create` (bash + PR body checklist in §ModeA-Blocks).

## Step 5. Done (Mode A Complete)

Report harvest candidate list and PR creation status to user.

## Invocation Triggers

### Auto-Proposal Conditions (detecting user conversation context)

Propose `/field-harvest` proactively when these patterns are detected:

| Pattern | Example | Proposal strength |
|---|---|---|
| **FH absorption intent** | "Should we push this to FH?", "Is this worth absorbing?", "harvest this pattern" | Immediate proposal |
| **Field pattern discovery** | "Found this pattern in my project", "There's something repeating on that side" | Immediate proposal |
| **FH improvement idea** | "What if we made this a skill?", "We could turn this into a rule" | Immediate proposal |
| **Field git log mention** | "Looking at the commits", "Checking recent changes", "What did I do this week?" | Proposal |

### Natural Language Triggers (activates without internal vocabulary)

| Example utterance | Intent |
|---|---|
| "This approach could be reused in other projects" | Cross-project pattern harvest |
| "Would be good to save what we found somewhere" | Pattern persistence → absorption |
| "If our team uses this, other teams probably can too" | FH sharing value detection |
| "This seems repetitive — can we automate it?" | Repeating pattern harvest candidate |
| "I forgot what we did last week and had to look it up again" | git log scan trigger |
| "session log", "log today's work", "sync to hub" | Mode B session log |

Proposal format:
```
"There seems to be a field pattern worth absorbing to FH. Scan with `/field-harvest`?"
```

### Simplification Guard

- If user has already invoked `/field-harvest`, no duplicate proposals
- If only 1 trigger pattern detected → light 1-line suggestion only (avoid over-intervention)
- If field cwd cannot be confirmed before proposing → first ask "which field project do you mean?"

---

## Simplification Guard (Global)

- **Domain code absorption forbidden**: Field domain logic is not an FH target — auto-skip when detected
- **Duplicate detection**: When a similar pattern already exists in FH, replace with "cross-reference existing assets then suggest merge"
- **Minimum validation criteria**: One-off patterns show as candidate + ★ 1 → recommend proper absorption after 3+ accumulations
- **PRD/sensitive data**: Diffs containing field PRD content or personal information are auto-masked and only the pattern is extracted

---

## External User Environment Adaptation

When project paths from the original developer environment are not present:

> The original developer's project paths are examples. In external environments, replace with your own project names/paths — Step 0 auto-discover handles detection automatically, no manual replacement needed.

- Step 0: Fallback to user-specified path
- Step 4: `GH_HOST` auto-detection (internal GHE vs github.com)
- FH ROOT: Auto-detect with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`

# Mode B: Session Log → Knowledge Hub Sync

Records session work from field projects to the knowledge hub when a session ends. Generates a session markdown file from git history only (no conversation context), then commits to the hub.

## Step 0-B. Locate Hub Path

Auto-detect knowledge hub location with 3-level priority: ① FH env vars (`FH_DIR`/`CC_HUB_DIR`) → ② auto-discover hub candidates near home → ③ ask user. Track subdirectory: field projects → `tracks/{project-name}/`, external collaborations → `tracks/external/{name}/`.

> **Detail**: See `SKILL_detail.md §ModeB-Blocks` — hub-locate bash, detection-skip inline-grep, session scan, session markdown template, hub commit bash, confirmation format — read when executing Mode B Steps 0-B–5-B.

## Step 0-B.1. Detection-Skip — Already-Logged Pattern Filter (item2)

Before scanning session work, build a **skip ledger** of commits already recorded in the hub so the same commit is not logged twice across sessions (re-runs, overlapping auto-trigger + explicit invocation, multi-session same-day work).

**Skip rule (behavioral)**: a field commit hash is **skipped** (excluded from Step 1-B scan output) if it already appears in any existing session file under the project's track directory.

> **Detection-skip style: stateless inline-grep (finalized).** FH uses the inline-grep form (bash in §ModeB-Blocks) rather than a persisted ledger file: it keeps no extra state to sync and is self-correcting — the hub session files *are* the ledger. Adequate at FH's scale.

If **all** of today's commits are already logged, report `"All N commits today are already logged to the hub — nothing new to record"` and exit (Mode B done, no empty session file written). This is also what the item1 auto-trigger consults to count *un-logged* commits — the auto-trigger must not fire on a session whose commits are all already logged.

**Limitations (honest)**: hash-prefix matching can collide on very short prefixes (use 7+ chars) and only catches commits that were logged with their hash listed in the `## Commits` section (Step 3-B always lists hashes, so hub-generated logs are covered). It does not dedupe *uncommitted* work — that is intentional, uncommitted changes have no stable identity to skip on.

## Step 1-B. Scan Current Session Work

Use the **detection-skip-filtered** commit set from Step 0-B.1 (already-logged hashes removed), not the raw `git log`. Also capture uncommitted changes via `git status --short`.

## Step 2-B. Extract Session Summary

**From git log only** (no conversation context — prevents hallucination):

1. **Context**: Infer from first commit message
2. **Solution**: Aggregate commit messages
3. **Commits**: List with hashes
4. **Next Session**: Parse TODO/FIXME via `git grep`
5. **Key Learnings**: Ask user (optional, 1–2 lines)
6. **FH Backport Points**: Auto-detect from "pattern"/"reusable" keywords in commits

## Step 3-B. Generate Session Markdown

Generate from the template in §ModeB-Blocks (Context / Solution / Commits / Next Session / Key Learnings / FH Backport Points / Tags). Filename: `session_YYYY_MM_DD_<slug>.md`.

## Step 4-B. Write + Commit to Hub

Write the session file and commit to the hub (bash in §ModeB-Blocks).

> **Push policy**: commit only. Push requires explicit user approval ("push해줘", "push it"). Do not auto-push — consistent with FH PR principle.

## Step 5-B. Confirmation

Output the confirmation block (file path + commit hash + push offer — format in §ModeB-Blocks).

## Step 5-B.1. UAP Update (Operational Adaptation Loop)

> Rule: `knowledge/shared/rules/operational_adaptation.md`

At field-session close, update the **User Adaptation Profile** (`tracks/_meta/user_adaptation_profile.md`, local/gitignored — skip silently if absent or in an ephemeral/cloud session):

1. **WRITE** — append this session's skill-proposal outcomes (`accepted`/`rejected`/`sustained`, same vocabulary as `operations.md`) + any new recurring friction. Behavioral prefs only — never domain content.
2. **Generalization check** — for any UAP entry that recurs across **2+ sessions/projects** (not user-specific), flag it as a **Mode A harvest candidate** (`≥40%` reject = redefine/deprecate candidate; `≥60%` accept = reinforce). Idiosyncratic entries stay local.

One pass per session; never blocks the Mode B commit.

## Done When

**Mode A (Pattern Harvest)**:
```
All stages Step 0~4 complete
+ Step 3 harvest candidate list output (N candidates + M field-only)
+ Upon user approval, Step 4 PR creation complete (gh pr create executed)
+ When 0 candidates, "no absorption candidates" reported then exit
```

**Mode B (Session Log)**:
```
All Steps 0-B ~ 5-B executed
+ Step 0-B.1 detection-skip ledger applied (already-logged commits filtered)
+ Session markdown file generated from git log  (or "all commits already logged" exit)
+ Hub commit created (no auto-push)
+ Confirmation output with push offer
```

Verdict: PASS (harvest candidates output and PR created, or 0 candidates confirmed) | CONDITIONAL_PASS (candidates found but PR pending user approval; or Mode B commit created, push pending) | FAIL (contention-layer blocked candidate registration; or hub path not found) | ESCALATE (role collision with existing skill requires human decision)

**→ Mandatory next: `contention-layer`** — run immediately after Step 3 candidate list is confirmed, before Step 4 PR creation. New patterns must be checked for collision with existing skill role clusters before registration. Skip only when 0 candidates found.

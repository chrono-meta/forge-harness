# install-doctor — Plugin Install Conflict Diagnosis

Diagnoses potential conflicts, duplicates, and overwrite risks that may occur when installing meta-harness plugins into an existing project.

**Can be installed standalone** — works correctly with plugin install alone, without cloning the full meta-harness.

## Triggers

```
/install-doctor                        # Full diagnosis of current environment
/install-doctor --plugin fh-meta       # Diagnose targeting a specific plugin
```

## Step 0. Runtime Environment Requirements Check

FH operates on the assumption of a large context window. If the environment is unsuitable, `Input is too long` 400 errors may occur during skill execution.

### Supported Environments

| Environment | Support | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code + Anthropic API Key | ✅ Recommended | 200K context · officially supported |
| claude.ai Pro / Team Plan | ✅ Recommended | 200K context · officially supported |
| AWS Bedrock (direct API) | ⚠️ Conditional | Possible with sufficient account quota — default quota may be low |
| Bedrock + claude-code-router + LiteLLM | ⚠️ Unofficial | Context limit exceeded frequently · not recommended |
| Internal AI API proxy | ⚠️ Conditional | Depends on max_input_tokens setting |

### Environment Check

```bash
# Detect community router (Bedrock bypass)
ls /opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@musistudio/ 2>/dev/null \
  && echo "⚠️  claude-code-router detected — routing via Bedrock/external proxy" \
  || echo "✅ No community router"

# Claude Code version
claude --version 2>/dev/null || echo "Claude Code not installed"
```

**⚠️ When Bedrock routing confirmed**: Request AWS quota increase (TPM/RPM increase) or raise LiteLLM `max_input_tokens`, then retry. Fundamental solution is switching to direct Anthropic API access.

### Node floor check — run on EVERY machine, not once per user

A user's context (companion store, memory, session card) travels between machines; **the machine's
own setup does not**. A rich context makes a fresh laptop read as "already configured", so the two
mechanical floors below must be checked per node — this is the check `scripts/fh_node_check.sh`
points at when it reports a missing floor at turn 0.

```bash
# HUB_DIR — the same variable the hook scripts use. Do NOT invent a second name (an earlier draft
# read FH_DIR, which nothing sets, so an operator with HUB_DIR set would have been silently told
# about a different repo).
FH="${HUB_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)}"

# ① git-side floor. Probe the EXECUTABLE HOOK, not the config key — `core.hooksPath` unset is a
#    normal, working install when hooks sit in .git/hooks, and a set-but-empty path is a broken
#    install that the key alone reports as fine. Both directions are wrong; the file is the truth.
#    Resolve the directory with `git rev-parse --git-path` rather than assembling "$FH/.git/hooks":
#    in a LINKED WORKTREE `.git` is a file, so the assembled path does not exist and every hook
#    reads as missing (verified: a worktree with working hooks reported ❌❌ under the old form).
#    Same resolution the script uses — one predicate, not two.
# --path-format needs git >= 2.31; on older git fall back to the RELATIVE --git-path form resolved
# against the toplevel, never to a hand-built "$FH/.git/hooks" (which is the worktree bug above).
HD="$(git -C "$FH" rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-path hooks 2>/dev/null)"
if [ -z "$HD" ]; then
  _rel="$(git -C "$FH" rev-parse --git-path hooks 2>/dev/null || echo .git/hooks)"
  case "$_rel" in /*) HD="$_rel" ;; *) HD="$(git -C "$FH" rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo "$FH")/$_rel" ;; esac
fi
for h in pre-commit pre-push; do
  if [ -x "$HD/$h" ]; then echo "✅ $h executable ($HD)"
  else echo "❌ $h MISSING or not executable at $HD — that gate is not running on this node"; fi
done

# ② turn-0 load floor (Mode D only): the companion-load hook. Its registration lives in the
#    GITIGNORED settings.local.json, so it does NOT survive a re-clone — hence a per-node check.
#    Parse the JSON and match the SCRIPT NAME inside hooks.SessionStart — not a bare grep for the
#    key. settings.json also carries a SessionStart entry (fh_node_check), so keying on the key
#    alone passes on a machine where the companion load is absent; and a plain substring grep also
#    hits commented-out lines, other hook events, and permission strings. Same predicate the script
#    uses — two predicates reading one state differently is how a result leaks silently.
#    Applicability gate FIRST, and keyed the same way the script keys it: a Mode D user is one with
#    an exported BE_DIR, or a CLAUDE.local.md that MENTIONS a companion binding — NOT one who merely
#    HAS a CLAUDE.local.md (that is Claude Code's standard local-override file; anyone may keep one),
#    and NOT one who has a settings.local.json (gitignored, so a fresh clone lacks it — and a fresh
#    clone with a full companion store is the exact case this must not silence). The vocabulary
#    covers every backend the wizard documents (vault · gbrain · *-be repo), because an FH-flavoured
#    regex would silence two first-class backends. It is a MENTION test, not semantic: "I do not use
#    a companion store" also matches, and that over-match costs one informational line — the cheap
#    direction, since the expensive direction is silence.
if { [ -n "${BE_DIR:-}" ] && [ -d "$BE_DIR" ]; } \
   || { [ -f "$FH/CLAUDE.local.md" ] && grep -qiE 'BE_DIR|companion[ -]store|컴패니언|vault|gbrain|obsidian' "$FH/CLAUDE.local.md"; }; then
  python3 - "$FH" <<'PY'
import json, os, sys
hub = sys.argv[1]
for p in (os.path.join(hub, ".claude", "settings.local.json"),
          os.path.expanduser("~/.claude/settings.json")):
    try: groups = json.load(open(p)).get("hooks", {}).get("SessionStart", [])
    except Exception: continue
    if any("fh_session_load" in h.get("command", "")
           for g in groups for h in g.get("hooks", [])):
        print("✅ companion-load SessionStart registered"); sys.exit(0)
print("❌ companion-load SessionStart MISSING — freshness + env-delta do not fire at turn 0")
PY
else
  echo "N/A  companion-load SessionStart (not a Mode D setup — no companion store configured)"
fi
```

**Bootstrap note — honest scope**: `scripts/fh_node_check.sh` (the check that *reports* a missing
floor at turn 0) ships with the clone, but its **registration does not**: every
`.claude/settings*.json` path in this repo is gitignored (confirm with `git check-ignore -v
.claude/settings.json` — don't trust a line number, they move), so no SessionStart entry can be
tracked. The tracked artifact is `templates/settings.SessionStart.snippet.json`; `/install-wizard`
merges it. A user who never runs the wizard still gets no turn-0 signal — that residual is reduced,
not closed, and this check item is the backstop for it.

**Emission model** (so the output is read correctly): a **missing floor is reported every session**
until it is fixed — it is a persistent condition, not an event. A healthy machine is silent. So
seeing this banner twice is not a bug, and seeing it once then never again means it was an *event*
line (identity change / infra delta), not a floor complaint.

**Fix for either ❌**: re-run `/install-wizard` (it registers both — `install-wizard/SKILL_detail.md`
§Mode-D-Companion-Setup step 3 and the 4-axis gate block), or apply the two commands it uses directly.

**Why this is a check item and not a note** (measured 2026-07-30): a second machine held the full
companion store and memory, yet ran with **both** SessionStart hooks absent. Nothing surfaced it —
the miss was found by accident. A weak tier is where this bites hardest: a mechanized floor is
tier-independent, while the prose it replaces is exactly what a weaker model drops first.

## Step 1. Existing Asset Inventory

```bash
# CLAUDE.md existence
[ -f "CLAUDE.md" ] && echo "CLAUDE.md exists: $(wc -l < CLAUDE.md) lines" || echo "CLAUDE.md absent"

# Existing skills
ls .claude/skills/ 2>/dev/null && echo "Existing skills present" || echo "No existing skills"

# Existing hooks
[ -f ".claude/settings.json" ] \
  && python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('.claude/settings.json')); print('hook events:', list(d.get('hooks',{}).keys()))" \
  || echo "settings.json absent"

# .claudeignore
[ -f ".claudeignore" ] && echo ".claudeignore exists" || echo ".claudeignore absent"

# Existing audit/log files
find . -maxdepth 3 -name "*audit*" -o -name "*weekly*" 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -v "node_modules\|\.git" | head -5
```

## Step 2. Conflict Diagnosis (5 Areas)

### 2-1. CLAUDE.md Rule Conflicts

```bash
grep -i -n "pr\|pull request\|audit\|review\|weekly" CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null | head -15
```

Judgment:
- Existing PR convention present → possible priority conflict with `harness-pr-reviewer` ⚠️
- Existing weekly audit present → possible format conflict with `harvest-loop` ⚠️

### 2-2. Skill Trigger Conflicts

```bash
find .claude/skills -name "SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null | while read f; do
  name=$(grep "^name:" "$f" | head -1)
  desc=$(grep "^description:" "$f" | head -1)
  echo "--- $name"
  echo "$desc"
done
```

If same trigger vocabulary exists in a meta-harness skill → unclear which skill will activate ⚠️

### 2-3. Hook Event Conflicts

```bash
[ -f ".claude/settings.json" ] && python3 -c "
import json
d = json.load(open('.claude/settings.json'))
for event, hooks in d.get('hooks', {}).items():
    print(f'{event}: {len(hooks)} hook(s)')
" || echo "No settings found"
```

Multiple hooks on same event → execution order unclear ⚠️

### 2-4. .claudeignore Scope Conflicts

```bash
cat .claudeignore 2>/dev/null | grep -v "^#" | grep -v "^$"
```

If .claudeignore blocks files that meta-harness skills read for diagnosis (CATALOG.md, tracks/, CLAUDE.md) → inaccurate skill results ⚠️

### 2-5. Audit/Log Practice Conflicts

```bash
find . -maxdepth 3 \( -name "*audit*" -o -name "*weekly*" -o -name "*retrospect*" \) \
  -not -path "./.git/*" -not -path "./node_modules/*" | head -10
```

If existing retrospective/audit files exist → `harvest-loop` will create files in separate format → dual management ⚠️

### 2-6. MCP HTTP Transport Security Check

```bash
# Check MCP server transport settings
grep -r "\"transport\"" .mcp.json 2>/dev/null | grep -i "http\|sse"

# List MCP servers using HTTP transport.
# `except: pass` made this exit 0 on ANY failure, so the `|| echo` fallback was dead code and a
# corrupt .mcp.json rendered identically to "no risky servers" — a silent pass on a security check.
# Four states, four distinct exits: absent(0) · unparseable(2) · risky(1) · all-stdio(0).
python3 - <<'PY'
import json, os, sys
p = '.mcp.json'
if not os.path.exists(p):
    print('  MCP-CHECK: NOT-APPLICABLE — .mcp.json absent (no MCP servers configured)')
    sys.exit(0)
try:
    d = json.load(open(p))
except Exception as e:
    print(f'  MCP-CHECK: UNPARSEABLE — {p}: {e}')
    print('  Transport risk UNMEASURED — this is NOT a pass. Fix the file and re-run.')
    sys.exit(2)
servers = (d.get('mcpServers') or {})
risky = [(n, (c or {}).get('transport', 'stdio')) for n, c in servers.items()
         if (c or {}).get('transport', 'stdio') != 'stdio']
if risky:
    for n, t in risky:
        print(f'  WARNING  {n}: transport={t} — verify localhost binding + auth')
    sys.exit(1)
print(f'  MCP-CHECK: PASS — {len(servers)} server(s), all stdio')
PY
```

> **Read the exit code, not just the text.** `2` (unparseable) is an *unmeasured* check and must be
> reported 🟧 in Step 3, never folded into 🟩. Known-pair calibration for this block: a deliberately
> truncated `.mcp.json` must yield `2`, and a config with one `transport: http` server must yield `1`.
> If both print nothing, the check is dead.

**Known MCP HTTP transport vulnerability patterns** (based on HTTP port exposure security principles): When MCP servers using HTTP/SSE transport expose ports without authentication, remote access risk within local networks may occur. stdio transport is not affected.

| Transport | Risk |
|---|---|
| `stdio` (default) | Safe — not subject to vulnerability pattern |
| `http` / `sse` | ⚠️ Risk if port exposed without authentication — verify firewall rules + access control |

**Recommendation**: HTTP transport MCP servers must confirm localhost binding + access control.

## Step 3. Diagnosis Report

```
## install-doctor Diagnosis Results

### 🟥 Immediate Action Required
- [empty if none]

### 🟧 Recommended to Check After Install
- [empty if none]

### 🟩 No Conflicts
- [safe confirmed items]

---
Diagnosis scope: CLAUDE.md rules · Skill triggers · Hook events · .claudeignore · Audit practices
```

**0 conflicts**: "Plugin install is safe in the current environment."

## Step 4. Layer A Fallback Guidance

The meta-harness CLAUDE.md's `## Session Start` Layer A auto-read (CATALOG.md · tracks/ · MEMORY.md) only works in the **meta-harness cwd**.

If you installed only the plugin in a different project cwd:
- Layer A auto-read = silent skip
- Alternative: Directly add `## Session Start` section to that project's CLAUDE.md, or manually read CATALOG.md

## Activation Triggers

| Phrasing pattern | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Pre-install check** | "Can I add this plugin?", "Will it conflict with my existing setup?" |
| **Post-install anomaly** | "Something seems off after install", "Things seem different than before" |
| **Explicit diagnosis request** | "Check for install conflicts", "Run environment check", "Any overlaps?" |

## Done When

```
Steps 0~4 completed                                              (mandatory-pass)
+ Step 0 node-floor results recorded per check, each as one of
  PASS / FAIL / UNMEASURED — never blank                          (measured: 2 floors —
                                                                   hook exec-bit, SessionStart
                                                                   registration)
+ Step 2-6 MCP transport check exited 0/1/2 and the exit code is
  carried into the Step 3 tier (2 = UNMEASURED → 🟧, never 🟩)     (mandatory-pass)
+ Step 3 diagnosis report emitted with a tier per area
  (🟥 immediate action / 🟧 check recommended / 🟩 no conflicts)   (mandatory-pass)
+ Verdict is derived from the recorded per-area tiers: 🟩 only if
  every area is 🟩 AND none is UNMEASURED                          (measured: count of
                                                                   non-🟩 areas == 0)
```

**Why `Steps 0~4`, not `1~4`**: Step 0 holds the only *mechanical floor* checks in this skill (hook
exec-bit, SessionStart registration, Node floor). Leaving it outside the completion condition let a
run report "done" having never touched the one part that is not judgement.

**Why the verdict is counted, not stated**: the previous condition was `"Plugin install is safe in
current environment" confirmed` — that measures whether a *sentence was printed*, which a run
satisfies by printing it. An unmeasured area (e.g. an unparseable `.mcp.json`) must not be
absorbed into 🟩; absence of a finding is not a finding of absence.

## Simplification Guard

- 0 existing assets (new environment) → output "New environment. No conflicts." and exit immediately in Step 1
- Scope separation from harness-doctor (harness structure) · context-doctor (token efficiency): this skill = install-time conflict diagnosis only
- Call `/harness-doctor` for structural checks needed after plugin install

# auto-decorrelation — Cross-Family Verifier Recruitment

The lever for catching a model's blind spots is **decorrelation, not repetition** — a model cannot find
its own family's flaws by repeating itself. FH's adversarial verification (Axis-2 challenger) dispatches
in-session at the session tier, **same family** as the governor. When frontier CLIs are installed and a
local GPU box is live, leaving them idle wastes the one thing that actually raises the verification
ceiling. This skill recruits a **cross-family** verifier for load-bearing changes — and degrades
honestly when none is available.

It is a thin recruitment-and-degrade **policy** that REUSES existing machinery: `agent-composer` does the
actual dispatch, `cross-ecosystem-synergy-detection` inventories tools, `token-budget-gate` gates spend,
the headless CLI patterns and the floor-tier canary already exist. Net-new = the discovery + the
family-diversity recruitment + the degrade ladder only. (A **composing policy skill** — it fans out to
several callees, so its token floor is higher than a leaf skill by design; this is composition, not
reinvention, and the chain is return-path-closed — Step 5 gates acceptance on the callee's back-trace.)

## Triggers

- "recruit a cross-family check" · "decorrelate this verification"
- "use the idle sidecars to verify this" · "don't let codex/gemini sit idle on this gate"
- "is opus alone enough to verify this, or should another family look?"
- "auto-decorrelation"

## Step 0 — Consent gate (default OFF)

External-CLI calls and credit spend are never silent. Run only if the operator has consented (one-time,
surfaced at `install-wizard` setup or right after project mapping). Consent is stored in the UAP
(`tracks/_meta/user_adaptation_profile.md` — behavioral pref, not domain content). No UAP / no consent
(incl. ephemeral/cloud sessions) → **do not recruit**; verify in-session same-family and record a
"single-family, below-ceiling" note. Consent wording is honest by requirement: *"멀티-CLI 사이드카로
단일 모델을 넘어서는 효과를 기대할 수 있습니다 — 100%는 아님(decorrelation은 향상이지 보장 아님).
가용 사이드카 없으면 자동으로 단일 세션으로 축소됩니다."*

## Step 1 — Load-bearing predicate (consent gates eligibility; this gates firing)

Fire only on **load-bearing** changes — the same predicate as the target-tier sim gate: gate infra ·
onboarding scaffolds · destructive/publish paths · routing/gate skills · **or any change whose output
another skill/gate consumes as trusted input** (a new synthesis/analysis skill, a corpus writer) — the
predicate tracks *downstream trust*, not only whether the artifact is itself a gate. Ordinary additive
edits stay in-session (cost guard). Consent ON ≠ always-fire: a small/low-stakes check silently stays
single-session even when sidecars are available.

## Step 2 — Sidecar discovery (mechanical, the anti-power-waste core)

Build the available panel at run time; absent tools **and unreachable endpoints** drop off silently:
```bash
# Sidecar-callable CLIs only. **Scope discipline**: the probe list is NOT "every agent CLI that exists".
# FH's main is Claude Code (vendor-native — `[[feedback_vendor_native_harness]]`), and the recommended
# cross-family sidecars are **codex and gemini/agy**. Other agent CLIs on the machine (opencode, qwen,
# hermes, cursor-agent …) are **runtimes a user works INSIDE**, not verifiers FH calls out to — being
# installed is not a reason to probe them. Adding one costs a maintenance surface and dilutes the panel;
# add only when a concrete task needs that family. (2026-07-19: four were added off a general CLI
# catalog and removed the same session — installed ≠ belongs in the panel.)
command -v codex >/dev/null && echo "codex"          # GPT family CLI
command -v agy   >/dev/null && echo "agy"            # serves Gemini AND GPT-OSS — probe the model
command -v gemini>/dev/null && echo "gemini"
command -v gh >/dev/null && gh copilot --help >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "copilot"
                                                     # ↑ gh EXTENSION, not a binary — `command -v copilot` misses it, and
                                                     #   `gh copilot --help` shows only the LAUNCHER (its sole flag is
                                                     #   --remove); the real flags live behind `--`.
                                                     # Call form (verified 2026-07-19 by live call — credits were consumed):
                                                     #   gh copilot -- -p '<prompt>' --model <model> --allow-all-tools
                                                     # **Same class as codex/agy**: `--model` selects among several families
                                                     #   behind ONE CLI ('auto' lets Copilot pick), so family MUST come from
                                                     #   the pinned/probed model (Step 3), NEVER from the CLI name.
                                                     # ★ SEAT TIER CHANGES ITS VALUE ENTIRELY — probe, never assume:

                                                     #     ([[reference_corp_env_decorrelation_panel]]).
                                                     #     ⚠️ BUT each family runs on Copilot's harness, not its vendor-native
                                                     #     one — Claude-via-copilot ≠ Claude Code, GPT-via-copilot ≠ codex,
                                                     #     Gemini-via-copilot ≠ agy. Per `[[feedback_vendor_native_harness]]`

                                                     #     not depth**: use it to widen the panel, and route the decisive

                                                     #   Because the panel it yields depends on the seat, Step 3's model probe
                                                     #   is not optional here: enumerate what this seat actually serves before
                                                     #   claiming family diversity.
                                                     # Cost shape: paid-seat credits. That makes it a strong *sidecar* but a
                                                     #   poor main driver — seat quota is spent faster than it is worth when
                                                     #   it drives the whole harness. Recruit it for decisive checks, not bulk.
                                                     # Residual: the launcher may fetch the CLI body on first call, so on a

# Local ollama serving-paths = canary tier (electricity-only). mac localhost is public → probed

# are covered: whichever box is not serving simply fails the probe and drops off.

```
**Shell note**: this block is `sh`-portable and is written so bash and zsh behave identically. Any
future edit that reintroduces `for e in $EP` re-opens the zsh drop above. A drop line on stderr is a
**finding, not noise** — carry it into the Step 6 degrade verdict rather than discarding stderr.
Endpoint resolution is a **mechanical env/file read** (not a prose instruction the runner must remember),
so this discovery is tier-independent — no target-tier sim owed. The extra-endpoint binding lives only in
the gitignored `tracks/_meta/sidecar_endpoints.env` (auto-synced to the companion store); the public skill
carries the probe logic, never the address.

## Step 3 — Family map by runtime model probe (NOT CLI name)

Tag each verifier by the model family **actually serving the request**, probed — not the CLI binary name.
`agy` serves both Gemini and GPT-OSS 120B, so "agy = Gemini" is wrong; resolve via the CLI's
`--model`/served-model. The binary→family table is only a fallback default. Recruit to **maximize family
diversity vs the orchestrator** (orchestrator = Claude/opus → recruit GPT or Gemini or local-Qwen).

## Step 4 — Recruit (cost-aware) + spend gate

- **Cost order**: local 4090 = electricity-only (cheapest — use for breadth pre-screen) · codex headless
  = hard-capped credit pool · agy = operator Gemini sub. So: local-Qwen for cheap breadth, then ONE
  frontier cross-family for the decisive check.
- **Spend gate (S-1)**: the **free local tier auto-fires** silently; any **paid** draw (codex/agy)
  surfaces a one-line `token-budget-gate` ask per run (*"recruiting codex (~N) — proceed?"*) unless the
  operator has set `paid_auto: true` in the UAP. One-time feature-consent ≠ consent to this spend now.
- Dispatch via `agent-composer` (no re-implementation of dispatch).
- **Wait mechanically — `scripts/sidecar_wait.sh` is the required form, not a suggestion (S-1b).**

  **The rule, before the command, because a Sonnet-tier blind sim of this section said the command
  reads as "the content" and everything after it as "color commentary" — and named peeking at the
  output file as the first thing it would do wrong in a hurry:**

  > **Never judge a sidecar by looking at its output file.** A live process and a dead one produce
  > the same zero bytes. The only readable verdict is the typed `SIDECAR_VERDICT=` line, and it
  > does not exist until the process has exited.

  ```bash
  printf '%s' "$prompt" | bash scripts/sidecar_wait.sh out.txt 900 -- codex exec -m gpt-5.5 -
  # → SIDECAR_VERDICT=COMPLETE exit=0 bytes=48489      (read out.txt)
  # → SIDECAR_VERDICT=TIMEOUT  waited=900s bytes=0     (still alive — NOT a result)
  # → SIDECAR_VERDICT=EMPTY    exit=0                  (the only state that means "it said nothing")
  ```

  The runner **refuses to emit a verdict while the process is alive**, so "the sidecar returned
  nothing" becomes unsayable until it has actually exited. Grep the typed `SIDECAR_VERDICT=` line;
  never judge by looking at the output file.

  **Why this is mechanical rather than a habit** — the bullets below already described bounding a
  sidecar, and a session that had them loaded still got it wrong on 2026-07-29: it backgrounded
  `codex exec` and `agy -p`, read the output files after **1 s and 30 s**, found them empty, and
  recorded *"both sidecars returned 0-output"* into a gate marker, a PR body, a session card, a
  memory file and a handoff. Both were running normally and both answered — codex with 48 KB and
  three findings, agy with a further HIGH, and **all four were real**; one of them showed the change
  under review was over-applied. So the measurement error nearly retired a working mechanism.

  **That is a second failure mode this section did not cover.** The bullets below describe a *hung*
  sidecar. An impatient read of a *healthy* one produces the identical observation — zero bytes —
  and only one of the two is a fault. Distinguishing them requires process state, which is exactly
  what a human eye on an output file cannot see and the runner always reports.

- **Liveness / hang-catch (the runner does the waiting; this is how to read a `TIMEOUT`).** A backgrounded CLI that hangs
  (stuck on a sandbox/file-tool prompt, auth, or network) **does not exit**, so the background-completion
  signal *never fires* — passive waiting is the wrong model and silently stalls the run (observed
  2026-06-27: a `codex exec` that asked to read repo files hung at 0-output with no session log, and the
  turn waited on a notification that could not come). So **bound it actively, never wait open-endedly**:
  - The timeout is the runner's second argument; pick it from the model's real latency, not from
    impatience (a reasoning model can be silent for minutes and still be working).
  - On `TIMEOUT`, watch a **progress signal**, not just process-alive: output bytes growing **and** the CLI's own
    session/log advancing (e.g. `~/.codex/sessions/<today>`). 0 output **and** no session created after a
    short bound (≈2–3 min for codex/agy) = **hung, not slow** → kill and recover, do not keep waiting.
  - **Recover, don't stall**: kill → diagnose (a file-tool/sandbox hang is the common cause) → retry with
    the **robust pattern** — inline the needed file content into the prompt via **stdin** so the sidecar
    needs no file tools (verified fix 2026-06-27: `{ instructions; cat file1; cat file2; } | codex exec -`
    succeeded where reading-files-itself hung) — or degrade to single-session with a recorded note.
  This is the sidecar twin of `mcp-circuit-breaker` (stop a stuck external call instead of hanging on it).

## Step 4.5 — Residency screen (mandatory, immediately before ANY external-family send)

**Every** payload this skill sends outward — the diff, the marker (Step 5's payload), the prompt
text itself — crosses a family boundary the moment a codex/agy/gemini sidecar is recruited.
"Sanitize before external-family dispatch" used to be a prose reminder with no consumer reading it
back (`[[feedback_half_externalization_slot_without_consumer]]` shape — a slot that exists but
nothing downstream checks). This step makes it mechanical:

```bash
python3 scripts/residency_closure_scan.py --files src/a.py docs/b.md   # every file you are about to send, as separate args (zsh: ${=var}, never an unquoted "$var")
```

`--files` (not the default closure-walk) because what matters is **what you are actually
sending**, not this skill's own dependency graph. Read the exit code, not the words:

| Exit | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | CLEAN — no organizational identifier found **within the scanner's own stated limits** (see its header — this is a screening result, not a safety guarantee) | Send. Record `residency=CLEAN(files=N)` in the crossfamily grounds (Step 6). |
| 1 | TAINTED — at least one payload file matched a residency pattern | Do not send as-is. Either strip/redact the tainted file(s) from the payload and re-scan, or route to an in-boundary panel member. If it truly cannot be cleaned, record `residency=TAINTED(N files, stripped=no)` and do NOT dispatch — the crossfamily value becomes a `DEGRADED_*` rung, never `panel(...)`. |
| 10 | HARNESS_ERROR — the scan itself could not run (commonly: no operator-private `.claude/rules/.residency-patterns` override on this machine — the shipped `.defaults` file alone is deliberately insufficient to claim CLEAN, per the scanner's own header) | Do not send. Record `residency=NOT_SCANNED(<reason>)` — same as exit 1's outcome (no dispatch), different reason (*could not screen* vs *screened and found something*). |

🟥 **On a fresh install with no operator pattern file, this WILL be exit 10 every time** — that is
the scanner's own documented fail-closed default (`residency_closure_scan.py`'s header: "오버라이드
파일이 없으면 exit 10 이다"), not a bug introduced here. It means: until an operator configures
their own residency patterns, this skill cannot claim a panel dispatch was screened, so it honestly
degrades to a `DEGRADED_*` rung with `residency=NOT_SCANNED(...)` instead of silently sending. That
is not a new block on fresh installs — the crossfamily field already tolerates `DEGRADED_*` without
hard-failing the commit; it is one more honest reason to be in that state, not a novel one.

**Where the result lands**: `templates/.git-hooks/pre-commit`'s `validate_crossfamily_leg` now
requires a `residency=CLEAN(...)` token inside the grounds of any `panel(...)` value (grace date
`RESIDENCY_TOKEN_GRACE_DATE`, no retroactivity on markers dated earlier), and accepts an optional,
format-checked `residency=(CLEAN|TAINTED|NOT_SCANNED)(...)` token on `DEGRADED_*`/`UNKNOWN`/
`declined`. Fixtures: `scripts/test_marker_crossfamily_lanes.sh` (`r1`–`r13`). This is the SAME
typed field Step 6 already emits into — one channel, not a second marker line.

## Step 4.6 — `evidence=` : say WHAT the panel received (mandatory with `panel(...)`, 2026-09-12)

`residency=` says the payload was safe to send. `evidence=` says **what was sent** — and that is the
axis the outside world just measured as the dominant one. `arXiv:2609.10969` (48 task templates →
2,880 scenarios, **fixed call budget** so the comparison is about the axis and not about spending
more): a cross-model vote over **shared** evidence approved **62.9 %** of unsafe proposals against
**22.9 %** with an **independent source** — source effect **40.9 pp** vs **11.3 pp** for model
diversity, i.e. **3.6×**.

Decide it from **how this run actually dispatched**, not from intent:

| What happened | Token |
|---|---|
| Every member got the **same** payload (one prompt file / one diff fanned out) | `evidence=SHARED(<name the artifact>)` |
| Each member produced its **own** evidence — own checkout, own run, own extraction | `evidence=INDEPENDENT(<what each got>)` |
| Some of each | `evidence=MIXED(<which member got which>)` |

🟥 **This skill's default flow is `SHARED`, by construction.** Step 4 builds **one** payload and fans
it out, so a panel dispatched the ordinary way through this skill is the **62.9 % arm** — the axis it
raises is model family, which the paper prices at 11.3 pp. That is not a reason to stop using it: a
finder is worth its recall, and this skill's value was never precision
(`[[feedback_decorrelation_is_a_cheap_finder]]`). It **is** a reason to stop recording that run as if
it carried the stronger axis. Write `SHARED` and mean it.

🟢 **`SHARED` is a legal, expected answer.** The hook does not block it; it blocks a `panel(...)` that
does not say which it was, a value outside the closed three, a malformed or duplicated token, and a
**vacuous body** on `SHARED`/`MIXED` (name the artifact — *"same staged diff"*, *"one findings.jsonl"*,
*"identical prompt file"*). `INDEPENDENT` is self-describing and is not body-checked, deliberately:
over-blocking the honest strong answer would train the override.

**Where it lands**: the same grounds line as `residency=`, in the same `crossfamily:` field —
`crossfamily: panel(codex) — residency=CLEAN(files=3) · evidence=SHARED(same staged diff to both) · R1, 3 findings`.
Hook: `validate_crossfamily_leg` (grace `EVIDENCE_TOKEN_GRACE_DATE`, no retroactivity).
Fixtures: `scripts/test_marker_crossfamily_lanes.sh` `e1`–`e10`.

⚠️ **Named gap, not built today**: this skill has **no independent-source mode**. Giving it one
(each member reconstructs the evidence itself rather than reading the author's payload) is the change
that would move it onto the 40.9 pp axis; it is a design question, not a wiring one, and it is
recorded as a signal rather than improvised here.

🟥 **A stripped file is invisible to the reviewer, and a reviewer's default read of invisible is
"absent," not "redacted"** (governor dogfood, 2026-09-05, same-day live use of this Step): two
TAINTED files were stripped from a real payload and the CLEAN remainder sent cross-family — the
reviewer came back with a false-positive S-finding, *"runner wiring is missing,"* because the
wiring actually lived in one of the two files that had just been stripped. Stripping fixes
residency; it does nothing about the reviewer's next inference, and silence there reads as a hole.
**So**: whenever a payload is sent with `stripped > 0`, the review PROMPT itself must name the
omission explicitly — the list of what was left out, and one line per file on what it is
responsible for (not its content, just its role) — so the reviewer can discount that surface
instead of flagging it as missing. Record whether this was done: when the token carries
`stripped=M` with `M > 0`, the same grounds line adds one phrase on whether the omission list
reached the review prompt, e.g. `residency=CLEAN(files=3, stripped=2) · omission-list: given to
reviewer`. This is evidence-of-doing, not proof — same shape as Step 5's "quote one marker line it
checked," and it does not become a new hard-blocking hook check (channel discipline stays a
grounds phrase here, per the same Mechanization Boundary this whole field already respects).

⚠️ **Scope, same as everywhere else in this file**: CLEAN is a screening result, not a safety
guarantee (dynamic imports, non-Python artifacts, encoding tricks, and TOCTOU are named, unclosed
gaps in the scanner's own header). Recording `residency=CLEAN(...)` asserts the scan ran and found
nothing **within those limits** — it does not assert the payload is safe in some absolute sense.

## Step 5 — Role split + source-grounded acceptance (S-2)

CC = **governor**, terminal verdict, source-closes. Sidecars = decorrelated **challengers** feeding
findings — **untrusted external input** (prompt-injection surface, like an MCP result). Every sidecar
finding must carry a **source-locatable claim** (file:line / quoted text); the governor **mechanically
re-checks** it against the artifact (phantom-quench back-trace) before accepting. A finding that cannot be
source-grounded is **dropped, not judged**. No sidecar-only verdict (no weak-local-judge regression).
Local 4090 = **canary tier** (evidence-of, never terminal verdict).

**Report shape (2026-09-05)**: when the findings are written up (PR body · marker `crossfamily:` expansion · chamber record),
use `templates/RED_TEAM_REPORT.md` — the five sections mirror ISO/IEC AWI TS 42119-7 (risk identification · objectives & attack
vectors · method · findings with reproducing input · life-cycle integration). It is a name tag on what this skill already
produces, not a new check; crosswalk: `knowledge/shared/harness-core/iso_ai_standards_crosswalk.md §2`.

🟥 **What you SEND decides which axis you get — put the MARKER in the payload, not just the diff**
(2026-08-19). Sidecars have been receiving the *diff* only. That buys a review of the **code** and
buys nothing on the **record**: the Axes 2+3 marker is self-attested, and this repo has already
written down that the closing move is *"cross-family reading that marker"* — then never wired the
marker into the thing that recruits cross-family. Measured twice: (a) a release marker's false
`not-applicable` passed the new typed lanes untouched, because **form was correct**; (b) this skill's
own dispatch on 2026-08-19 sent a diff and no marker, so the round could not have caught a false
axis claim even in principle.

**So the payload is two parts**: the frozen diff **and** the marker for this change — **as it stands
at dispatch time**: `axes-run:` · `controls:` · `standpoint:` · `thirdparty:` · `residual:`.

🟥 **`crossfamily:` is NOT in the payload — it is this round's OUTPUT.** Step 6 below says every rung
*emits* that value and "the rung is not done until its verdict is recorded", so requiring it in the
thing you send is circular: you would be shipping a field this dispatch has not produced yet. Send the
marker with that line **absent or `UNKNOWN`**, and fill it from the result. (Caught by a blind
floor-tier sim of this very paragraph, 2026-08-19 — the first draft listed `crossfamily:` among the
payload fields and no reader could have satisfied it.) Ask the sidecar one extra
question: *"does the record match the diff — is any axis claimed that the diff shows no trace of, and
is any residual missing that the diff implies?"*

⚠️ **Scope, deliberately narrow.** This asks whether the record is **consistent with the artifact**.
It does NOT ask the sidecar to score honesty — «is this marker truthful» is a *conclusion*, and
§Mechanization Boundary forbids freezing that into machinery. Consistency is checkable from two
documents; honesty is not.
⚠️ **You cannot observe that the sidecar READ it — say so rather than implying otherwise.** Putting the
marker in the payload and the sidecar actually using it are different events, and nothing here
distinguishes them: a silently-ignored marker looks exactly like a marker that was read and raised
nothing. The cheap partial anchor is to require the return to **quote one marker line it checked** —
a reply that quotes nothing did not demonstrably read it. That is evidence-of-reading, not proof, and
it does not close §Mechanization Boundary's named self-attestation residual. Three independent
readers flagged this same gap on the day the paragraph was written (a peer session, and two blind
floor-tier sims), which is why it is stated here instead of left to the reader to notice.

⚠️ **Prose, not a check** — measured recurrence is 2, below this repo's own N≥3 bar
(`[[feedback_mechanize_at_repetition_prose_before]]`). On the third occurrence, mechanize it here.
⚠️ **Residency still governs**: a marker can name company assets. Run Step 4.5's screen against the
marker file too, not just the diff — the marker is not exempt because it is metadata. (This line was
pure prose until 2026-09-05; Step 4.5 above is what closes it — the scan itself still carries the
named, unclosed gaps in its own header, so "screened" is not "guaranteed safe".)

*Origin*: sister-asset read of `raphaelchristi/harness-evolver`'s `harness-critic` agent, whose whole
role is auditing the **evaluator** rather than the artifact. Its detection signatures (score jumps,
suspiciously fast convergence) do **not** port — FH markers carry no score — but the *target* does.
Full assessment incl. what was deliberately not imported: `tracks/_audit/proposal_2026-08-19_sister_harness-evolver.md`.

**Target freeze — a prior drop reason, checked before any of the above (2026-08-17).** Grounding a
finding against *today's* tree proves nothing if the sidecar reviewed *yesterday's*. Pin before
dispatch and verify on return:

```bash
bash scripts/target_freeze.sh pin    "$REPO" "$ROUND_LABEL"   # 발주 직전
bash scripts/target_freeze.sh verify "$REPO" "$ROUND_LABEL"   # 회수 직후
```

`rc 1` = **WRONG-TARGET → drop the whole round's findings**, not individual ones — the round read a
tree that moved under it, so which findings survive is not decidable from the output. `rc 10` =
UNKNOWN (could not measure) — that is **not** a pass; re-pin and re-dispatch. Measured trigger: three
occurrences in one day, one of which was sending a sidecar a **pre-repair diff** and then grounding
its findings against the repaired tree — every finding "failed to ground", and the instrument, not
the reviewer, was wrong.

🟥 **What this does NOT cover**: §L191's inlined-file pattern. When the prompt carries file contents
on stdin (the robust form for sidecars that have no file tools), the tree freeze says nothing about
**what bytes you actually sent**. That binding is still owed and is not claimed here.

## Step 6 — Degrade ladder (the intelligent scale-down)

**Consent branch first — declined ≠ degraded** (`[[capability_escalation_consent]]`): if the UAP has
`sidecar_consent: declined`, do **not** probe/recruit — route straight to **Tier-3 CC-only sub-agent
verification** (multiple isolated Claude sub-agents, isolation-decorrelation) as a **first-class chosen
mode**, with an honest *same-family* note but **no "reduced value / degraded" framing** — the user chose
this floor. `unset` → ask-once at first load-bearing need (accept → proceed; decline → record + this
branch). Only proceed to the discovery ladder below when consent is `accepted`.

Every rung **emits a typed `crossfamily:` value into the Axes 2–3 marker** — the rung is not
done until its verdict is recorded. The value is a closed enum, validated by `pre-commit`
(`validate_marker_floor`, fixtures in `scripts/test_marker_crossfamily_lanes.sh`); free prose is
rejected at commit time.

| # | Panel state | Emit | Ack |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | frontier cross-family CLI present → recruit it (decorrelated, at-floor) — best | `panel(<families>)` | — |
| 2 | only local 4090 → canary pre-screen + in-session opus governor (canary, not full decorrelation) | `panel(<families>)` **only if** a capable non-Claude model actually reviewed; otherwise rung 3 | — |
| 3 | **probed and nothing capable reachable** → in-session same-family | `DEGRADED_SINGLE_FAMILY` | **required** |
| — | **capable panel reachable, not recruited** (a choice, not a constraint) | `DEGRADED_PANEL_UNUSED` | **required** |
| — | consent `declined` (branch above — chosen floor, not a degrade) | `declined` | — |
| — | change is not load-bearing — decorrelation not required | `single-family` | — |
| — | **panel never probed** | `UNKNOWN` | **required** |

🟥 **Rungs 1–2's `panel(<families>)` additionally require a `residency=CLEAN(...)` token inside the
same grounds string, since 2026-09-05** (Step 4.5 above; `pre-commit`'s `validate_crossfamily_leg`
blocks a bare `panel(...)` with no such token on a marker dated on/after
`RESIDENCY_TOKEN_GRACE_DATE`). Full grammar:

```
crossfamily: panel(codex) — residency=CLEAN(files=7) · R1..R2, 4 findings
crossfamily: DEGRADED_SINGLE_FAMILY — residency=TAINTED(2 files, stripped=no) → not sent, probed codex/agy, 0 reachable
crossfamily: DEGRADED_SINGLE_FAMILY — residency=NOT_SCANNED(no operator pattern file) → not sent, probed codex/agy, 0 reachable
```

The token is **optional** on `DEGRADED_*`/`UNKNOWN`/`declined` (format-checked only when present —
those rungs never claimed anything left the boundary, so nothing to require) and **rejected as a
contradiction** if `panel(...)` carries `residency=TAINTED(` or `residency=NOT_SCANNED(` on the same
line — a sent payload and an unscreened/tainted one cannot both be true.

**The three degrade values are the load-bearing split**: *could not* (`DEGRADED_SINGLE_FAMILY`) ·
*did not* (`DEGRADED_PANEL_UNUSED`) · *did not look* (`UNKNOWN`). Free prose merges all three, and
each merge hides a different thing — an unrun probe renders as a zero finding
(`[[feedback_not_found_is_not_zero_family]]`), and an unused panel renders as an unavailable one.
The sibling-harness signal that motivated this field said it in its own words about itself:
*"못 한 것이 아니라 안 한 것이다."* All three require an ack naming *what was probed and what it
returned*. **`DEGRADED_PANEL_UNUSED` was added by dogfooding**: the first real marker written under
this lane found the panel reachable (codex · agy · gemini) and no cross-family review run — a state
the original five-value enum could not express without lying
(`[[feedback_adversarial_review_not_substitute_for_first_use]]`).

**Panel membership is capability-gated, and ineligibility is tested FIRST.** A runtime `/models`
list is a **serving** list, not a generative one. Measured in a sibling harness (2026-08-08): 6 of
14 served entries could not review anything (embedding · reranker · OCR · safeguard), and because
the embeddings' ids matched no family prefix **each counted as its own family — satisfying the
family-diversity check while the panel was incapable**. Order is the invariant, not the list:
`GLM-OCR` matches both `ocr` and `glm`, `Qwen3-Embedding` matches both `embed` and `qwen`, so an
eligibility-first test lets them through silently. If nothing capable survives the filter, that is
rung 3 — **not** a smaller panel.

**Attribution: `panel(...)` records the families *requested*, not confirmed.** At least one
procurement path (an internal corp-gateway CLI) returns **no model attribution in its response**, so "3/3 responded"
does not establish which model contributed. Record request-fact and response-fact separately; do not
launder the former into the latter (`[[feedback_instrument_cannot_discriminate_hypotheses]]`).

Env non-determinism (CLI presence varies) → **never hard-fail the run** — but never *silent* either.
The two are different properties, and the prose this replaces conflated them: the degrade proceeds
(a commit is a reversible surface) **and** lands in the verdict with an ack. That is how this rung
and `CLAUDE.md` §Field-Harness gate ("never a silent same-family pass") are simultaneously true.
Distinguish the **unavailable-but-wanted** case (consent given, panel down → `DEGRADED_SINGLE_FAMILY`
+ ack; for a *load-bearing corp* surface, fail-closed per `local_pmh_context.md` — note that file is
**pmh-repo-local and unreadable from an FH session**, so on this side the typed value + ack is the
enforceable layer) from the **declined** case above (chosen floor, first-class, no degrade framing).

**Step 6.5 — Standpoint axis (2026-08-14, orthogonal to the family ladder above)**: for a
**shared-body / cross-harness-boundary** change — scoped by *effect* (alters another harness's
behavior, gate outcome, or interaction contract), not merely by touching a synced file path — also
emit `standpoint:` alongside `crossfamily:` in the same marker — recruiting family diversity here
does not substitute for it. Values: `tier1` (content-only, the default) · **`tier1b(<harness>)`
(STATIC read of the target's own files — executed nothing)** · `tier2(<harness>)`
(peer-simulated — **EXECUTED CODE in** the target's own repo and observed the result.
🟥 **Reading the target's real files, however cold, is `tier1b`, not this.** The discriminator is
mechanical: *name the command you ran and the output you saw*; cannot name one → `tier1b`, always.
This line said **"ran the target's own repo, content only"** until 2026-08-17 — actively teaching
the opposite of the canon it summarizes. 🟥 **RETRACTED (2026-08-17)**: this passage used to add
that blind Sonnet sims *"STILL graded a pure cold-read `tier2`, both quoting this phrasing"* after
the other two copies were fixed. Those runs had **`tool_uses: 0`** — nothing was read, so nothing
was measured, and the claim that the sims "reached for this copy" was itself unfounded
(`tracks/_meta/fh_completed_2026-08-16.md:690`; the live re-run inverted the grade at reps=1, below
bar). **The reason to fix this copy needs no sim**: a summary that states the opposite of its canon
teaches the opposite to whoever reads only the summary, and **two of three copies fixed is a fix
that does not exist** — that is gate-locality, not a measurement. See `§7` for the canon) · `tier2b(<harness>)` (same operator,
target's real runtime — local wiring visible, but not an independent reviewer) · `tier3(<harness>)`
(a *different* operator of the target harness ran it — the only fully independent + local-wiring
rung) · `not-applicable` (no target-harness standpoint exists — most same-repo dispatches) ·
`DEGRADED_NO_TARGET_ACCESS` / `DEGRADED_NOT_RUN` / `UNKNOWN` (own literals, not crossfamily's). Note
the naming collision with this session's own persona/viewpoint sense of "standpoint" (the `beginner`/
`main-player`/`expert` agent roster) — different axis, same English word; do not conflate.
**Prose-only** — no hook or fixture validates this field yet, unlike `crossfamily:`, and
mechanizing it is FH's own job (a syncing sibling harness cannot add the check locally without its
own sync process rejecting the divergence). **Timing — same moment as Axis 2/3
(steel-quench/phantom-quench), not a follow-up**: run on the local diff before the first push to
any remote (public or private — no visibility judgment to make), one unconditional rule regardless
of perceived risk — see `field_verdict_crossfamily_gate.md §7 Sequencing` for why (a real PR pushed
this exact field to a public repo with two residency leaks in view, caught only after the PR was
already open). Full field spec, trigger scope, and evidence:
`knowledge/shared/harness-core/field_verdict_crossfamily_gate.md §7`.

**Done When** (Step 6.5): `standpoint:` is emitted whenever the change is a shared-body/
cross-harness-boundary change by the effect-based trigger above; `not-applicable` carries grounds
on the same line naming what was checked; **the review ran on the local diff before the first push**
— a `standpoint:` value first recorded after the PR is already open does not satisfy this condition,
even if the value itself is correct *[judged — no mechanical anchor today; adversarial pairing: a
reviewer/challenger may request both the grounds and the pre-push timing be shown in the PR capsule,
and reject a bare `not-applicable` or a post-hoc value]*.

## Step 7 — Output

Sidecar findings → existing synthesizer / Axes 2-3 marker. **Marker honesty (M-3)**: record
`axis2-engine: panel(<families>)` **only** when a captured sidecar transcript (raw stdout / headless exit
metadata) is embedded — a panel claim without a captured transcript is recorded as same-family by the
weekly audit, not panel. **Proven-uplift gate**: the marker may call the panel uplift *proven* **only**
when a `tracks/_meta/decorrelation_calibration_*` file with N≥3 exists; below that it records "breadth,
not-yet-conclusive" (mechanical N≥3 check, not a prose label — closes the salience gap on a weaker tier). **Contention (M-2)**: route to `contention-layer` ONLY when families return
**opposite terminal verdicts on the same claim** (one says S-blocker, other clean on the identical line) —
merely-different findings are normal decorrelation and union into the synthesizer; cap contention routing
at N per run (no loop).

## Done When

- Mechanical sidecar discovery returns the available panel. *[mandatory-pass]*
- Family-diversity recruitment picks ≥1 cross-family verifier when present (family by model probe). *[mandatory-pass]*
- Degrade ladder applied AND its verdict emitted as a typed `crossfamily:` value in the Axes 2–3
  marker (`panel(<families>)` | `declined` | `DEGRADED_SINGLE_FAMILY` | `DEGRADED_PANEL_UNUSED` |
  `UNKNOWN`); the three degrade values carry substantive grounds on the same line. `single-family`
  is NOT accepted on a load-bearing change — that block only runs there, so "decorrelation not
  required" is a contradiction, and as a no-ack pass it was a free bypass of the lane.
  *[mandatory-pass — enforced by pre-commit, fixtures `scripts/test_marker_crossfamily_lanes.sh`]*
- Step 4.5's residency screen ran against the actual send list before any `panel(...)` claim, and
  its result is recorded as a `residency=CLEAN|TAINTED|NOT_SCANNED(...)` token inside the same
  `crossfamily:` grounds — required when the value is `panel(...)`, format-checked when present on
  a degrade value. *[mandatory-pass — enforced by pre-commit since RESIDENCY_TOKEN_GRACE_DATE,
  fixtures `scripts/test_marker_crossfamily_lanes.sh` `r1`–`r13`]*
- Panel members are review-capable: embedding/reranker/OCR/safeguard classes are excluded **before**
  family-diversity is counted, never after. *[mandatory-pass — same fixtures, ordering anchor c4/c5]*
- Paid recruit was per-run spend-gated (or `paid_auto` set); free local tier may auto-fire. *[mandatory-pass]*
- Governor (CC) retains terminal verdict; every accepted sidecar finding is source-grounded. *[judged, pair: judge-robustness / phantom-quench back-trace]*
- Marker records panel + families only with a captured sidecar transcript. *[mandatory-pass]*
- **Calibration is current (ongoing, S-3)**: the skill claims *proven* decorrelation only after
  `tracks/_meta/decorrelation_calibration_*.md` shows cross-family > same-family recall on a held-out
  gate-bug set across **N≥3**; below N≥3 it recruits for breadth and labels uplift "measured, not yet
  conclusive" (calibration #1 = 2026-06-21, modest lift). *[measured]*

## Guards

- **Consent-default-OFF + paid-asks** — no surprise credit spend.
- **No sidecar-only verdict** — governor source-closes; ungroundable findings dropped.
- **Honest caveat is load-bearing** — "100% 아님": decorrelation is an expected uplift, measured not
  assumed (naive stacks score 0 — `feedback_harness_ceiling_principle`).
- **Silent degrade** — missing CLIs never hard-fail; the gap is recorded, not hidden.
- **No-reinvention** — discovery + family-diversity policy + degrade ladder only; dispatch, inventory,
  budget, canary all reuse existing assets.

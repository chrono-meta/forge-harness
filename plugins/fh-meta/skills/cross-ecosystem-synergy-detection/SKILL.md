# cross-ecosystem-synergy-detection — Multi-Ecosystem Automatic Synergy Discovery

Automatically discovers cross-invocable pairs in environments with multiple installed plugins and cross-CLI tools, and derives a synergy ranking table.

## Activation Triggers

1. **Multi-ecosystem component environment specified**: "multiple plugins/cross-CLI installed", "synergy with other components", "cross-ecosystem", "run together"
2. **New component added/removed**: "component install", "add/remove component"
3. **Synergy check phrasing**: "are they working in isolation?", "can they be integrated?", "environment check", "combination effect"
4. **Registry change detected** (optional): If a user-maintained `LOCAL_SKILL_REGISTRY.md` is present, Step 7 runs when a new project/skill is registered. The registry is not auto-created — absent file → Step 7 reports `[NOT-CONFIGURED]` and skips its body (see Step 7-1 outcome table).

**Exception**: Single-component environments (1 or fewer installed → no meaningful activation)

### Natural Language Triggers (General user phrasing — activates without internal vocabulary)

| Example phrasing | Intent |
|---|---|
| "Do my installed tools work well together?" | Check synergy of installed plugins/skills |
| "Would using this and that together be better?" | Explore cross-invocation possibilities |
| "I have multiple plugins installed in Claude — am I using them well?" | Diagnose installation ecosystem utilization |
| "My tools seem to be working in isolation" | Detect namespace/cwd fragmentation |
| "I just installed something new — check for conflicts with existing setup" | Check after adding new component |
| "I have multiple installs but not sure if I'm using them right" | Diagnose installation ecosystem utilization |
| "Wouldn't this and that work better together?" | Explore cross-invocation possibilities |
| "My tools feel disconnected and inconvenient" | Detect namespace/cwd fragmentation |
| "Wouldn't combining these plugins be more powerful?" | Explore component combination synergies |
| "I feel like there's synergy here — find it" | Automatic cross-invocation pair discovery |
| "Do my harnesses have synergy with each other?" | **Step 3-b standalone** — harness-level scan |
| "Can I transplant a governance pattern from another project?" | **Step 3-b standalone** |
| "Could I bring that project's gate over here?" | **Step 3-b standalone** |
| "하네스끼리 시너지" · "거버넌스 패턴 이식" · "다른 프로젝트 게이트 가져올 수 있나" | **Step 3-b standalone** |
| "이 하네스에 시너지 몰아줘" · "focus the synergy on this one" · "이거 하나 집중해서 강화" | **focus mode** — Step 3-b **+ Step 3-c by default** |
| "밖에도 이런 거 있나" · "더 강화할 방법 있어?" · "is there prior art that would make this stronger?" | **Step 3-c** |

> **Step 3-b fires standalone.** The last four rows call that step alone; they do not require the full
> door-④ pass. A request about *harnesses* is not a request about *installed plugins*.

## Processing Steps (7-step)

### Step 1. Installation Inventory Direct Inspection

```bash
cat ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json
```

**Schema (measured 2026-08-11, `version: 2`)** — read this before writing any parser:

```
{"version": 2,
 "plugins": {                       # DICT, not a list
   "<plugin>@<marketplace>": [      # value is a LIST of entries
     {"gitCommitSha": …, "installPath": …, "installedAt": …,
      "lastUpdated": …, "scope": …, "version": …}
   ]}}
```

The plugin **name is the dict key**, not an entry field — `entry.get('name')` is always `None`,
and iterating `for pl in data['plugins']` yields **key strings**, not entry dicts.
`gitCommitSha` is **optional** (measured: present on 5 of 11 installs) — see Step 5 drift.

Additional checks:
- `~/.claude/settings.json` `enabledPlugins` (actually active assets)
- Check `installed_plugins.json` ↔ `enabledPlugins` consistency (catch drift)

### Step 2. Asset Matrix Extraction per Component

```bash
for T in skills agents commands .mcp.json hooks; do
  if [ -e "$IP/$T" ]; then echo "PRESENT $T"; ls "$IP/$T"; else echo "ABSENT  $T"; fi
done
```

Extract each asset's frontmatter `description` + `allowed-tools` + `model`. Merge `plugin.json keywords`.

**`ABSENT` is a state, not a zero.** Most plugins ship only a subset (measured on `fh-meta`:
`skills`/`agents` present, `commands`/`.mcp.json`/`hooks` absent). Carry `ABSENT` through to
the matrix — an absent asset class must not be counted as "0 assets found", which would read as
an inspected-and-empty component.

### Step 3. Cross-Invocation Possible Pair Matrix Derivation

Call mechanism compatibility:
- **Skill**: Can be called directly as `{component-name}:{skill-name}`
- **Agent**: Can be called directly as `{component-name}:{agent-name}` via subagent_type
- **Hook**: Auto-triggered (no direct cross-component calls)
- **MCP**: Per-tool calls (namespace separated)

### Step 3-b. Harness-level pattern-transplant scan (conditional default)

**Condition**: 2+ mapped field-harness tracks exist. 🟥 **Establish the count by running
`bash scripts/mapped_tracks.sh` — never by listing `tracks/` from the session's cwd.** The mapping
signal is the *presence* of `tracks/<name>/`, and that signal cannot reach a worktree: `tracks/**` is
gitignored, and at least one mapped track is an **empty directory** git could not carry even if it
were not. Measured 2026-08-22, one run: **main checkout 11 · worktree 1** — a cwd listing does not
return a smaller count, it returns a structurally blind one, and `skipped(<2 mapped tracks)` is a
*pass* value, so the blind run closes green. The script resolves the hub root through
`git rev-parse --git-common-dir` (the `EVIDENCE_ROOT` pattern this repo already sanctions in
`templates/.git-hooks/pre-commit`) so both standpoints answer alike.
🟥 **`status=UNMEASURED` (exit 3) is NOT a skip** — it means the count could not be taken, which is a
different value from "fewer than two". Close it as `external-error` (non-pass); never as
`skipped(<2 mapped tracks)`. Underscore-prefixed meta dirs (`_meta`/`_audit`/`_contrib`/`_chamber`)
do not count — the test is a **leading** underscore, so a track like `the_bible` is counted.
Otherwise skip with one line.

Steps 1–3 look at **installed plugins/skills**. This step looks one layer up: the **governance
mechanisms of the mapped field harnesses themselves** — verification axes, verdict enums, gate exit
codes, persona systems — and finds pairs where one harness's mechanism is transplantable into another.

- Read each mapped track's **canon** (`CLAUDE.md` / `README.md`), not its code. Field-harness
  vocabulary must not be normalized into general concepts — that is this repo's habitual failure.
- Emit **transplantable pairs only**: the two must share the *same problem shape*. Merely overlapping
  subject matter is excluded.
- 🟥 Declare the read depth. "Read the top ~150 lines of CLAUDE.md" is a different claim from "read the
  file"; say which, and mark anything not opened as **unverified**, never as absent.
- Store under its **own section** in the Step 6 result file, separate from the skill/agent pair table —
  the two layers answer different questions and merging them hides which one produced a finding.

> **Boundary with Step 7**: Step 7 (proactive) may *trigger* Step 3-b; it does not replace its scan.
> Step 7 decides *when to offer*, Step 3-b decides *what to read and which transplant pairs come out*.
>
> **Detail**: See `SKILL_detail.md §Step3b-Provenance` — why Step 3-b is a default (2026-08-21/22 live door-④ runs) and its provenance signals — read when questioning why Step 3-b runs unasked.

### Step 3-c. Outward pass — strengthen the pairs (identity ④ loop)

**Condition (default is scoped, not always-on)**: runs by default only in **focus mode** — when the
operator names one harness to concentrate synergy on. In whole-environment mode it is **offered, not
run** (operator, 2026-08-22: *"로컬 내 플젝 간 시너지는 딱히 영향이 크게 없겠지만 이후 세션에는 또
새로운 정보를 얻을 수 있겠지"* — worth doing, not worth doing every time).

This is identity ④ (**프런티어 답습**) applied to synergy, and its purpose is the same as that
identity's: **block reinvention.** 📚 *bookshelf = don't rebuild what we already have* ·
🌍 *library = don't rebuild what the world already made.*

**The loop** — ② is a judgment and stays with the session; no hook decides it:

```
Steps 1–3-b produced pairs (📚 bookshelf: our own components + mapped harnesses)
      ↓  ② is there ANYTHING you cannot assert confidently about a pair?
         (threshold is «even slightly» — «I'm fairly sure» is the setting where this never fires)
      ↓  three outcomes, and COUNT THEM SEPARATELY
   ⓐ closed by thinking     — **no tool call was made**; reasoning settled it
   ⓑ closed at the bookshelf — **a Read/Grep against local canon actually ran** and answered it
   ⓒ went to the library     — an outward call was made (below)
```
🟥 **The three are separated by TOOL CALLS, not by how it felt.** ⓐ = zero calls · ⓑ = a local read
happened · ⓒ = an outward call happened. Written that way the split is checkable against the session's
own tool history instead of being self-reported — which is what an earlier draft left it as.
⚠️ **Never fold ⓐ into ⓑ.** «I already knew it from the bookshelf» with no Read is **ⓐ**, not ⓑ.
Folding inflates the "closed at the bookshelf" column, and that column is the one that says whether
this loop works at all.

**Record it per pair, not as a total.** A bare `run(2/3/1)` cannot be checked — it says the three were
counted without showing which pair went where. Step 3-c emits a **pair ledger**:

```
pair | what I could not assert | outcome ⓐ/ⓑ/ⓒ/withheld | bookshelf pointer or query shape | note
```
and the arithmetic has to close: **ⓐ + ⓑ + ⓒ + withheld == in-scope pair count.** A pair that appears
in no row is a dropped pair, not a passing scan.

**Two result types — keep them apart** (they feed different steps):
- `strengthener` — a technique or prior art that makes an existing pair better. **This is what
  Step 3-c is for.**
- `equivalent-risk` — the outside already has the whole thing. That is **Step 6's question**, not this
  one; hand it down rather than acting on it here. Mixing them is how «강화» quietly becomes «폐기».

**Residency — narrow, and stated at its real size.**
Searching does **not** leak by itself. The only **semantic payload we intentionally send** is the query
string — ⚠️ not the only surface at all (account and tool logs, which results were opened, any follow-up
fetch path all exist); it is the one carrying meaning we chose. And the natural way to look for prior art
is already abstract — nobody searches for a technique by typing their own repo name.
So this is one careless-phrasing case, not a reason to fear the step:
- **Keep harness names, repo names, paths and internal codenames out of the query.** Send the **problem
  shape** — «a gate whose verdict is a typed enum, transplanted into a repo that greps prose».
- It bites unevenly: some mapped harnesses are **company assets**, and `internal repo/asset names` is on
  the residency prohibition list by name. Public ones are not. **Check which side a pair sits on before
  wording the query**, rather than treating every name as equally sensitive.
- A pair that genuinely cannot be abstracted without naming a private asset stays home — record
  `outward: withheld (residency)`, a *recorded* skip rather than a silent one.
- Results come back and are matched to pairs **locally**; the matching never goes out.

**What comes back, and what it is for**: not «who else built this» trivia — a **prior art or a
technique that would make an existing pair stronger**. If the outward pass produces no such thing,
that is a normal result: record `outward: run, 0 applicable`. 🟥 Do **not** manufacture a finding to
justify having looked.

**Boundary with Step 6** — do not merge these, they answer opposite questions:

| | question | when |
|---|---|---|
| **Step 3-c** (this) | *is there something outside that would **strengthen** these pairs?* | during derivation |
| **Step 6** «Confirm absence of equivalent external tools» | *does an equivalent already exist, i.e. are we **reinventing**?* | at persistence |

Both are «external»; only one of them is asking whether to keep going.

### Step 4. Synergy Grade Derivation (★~★★★)

| Grade | Compatibility conditions |
|---|---|
| **★★★** | Directly complementary work areas + immediate cross-invocation compatible |
| **★★** | Complementary work areas + callable but cwd mismatch at certain points |
| **⚠️★** | Cross-invocable but risk of work area conflict |

★★★ found → candidate for automatic cross-invocation documentation  
⚠️★ found → document risk + explicitly state avoidance rules

### Step 5. Risk Catch

- **cwd fragmentation**: Component A and B operating in different cwds → work area separation
- **Namespace conflict**: Same skill name exposed across multiple components simultaneously
- **Drift**: Install path commit SHA ↔ original repo HEAD mismatch. **Three states, not two** —
  `gitCommitSha` is absent on marketplace installs (measured: 6 of 11), and an absent SHA is
  **`DRIFT-UNKNOWN` (cannot be checked)**, never "matches". Report `MATCH / DRIFTED /
  DRIFT-UNKNOWN(n=…)` and **never fold `DRIFT-UNKNOWN` into the match count**
- **Hook conflict**: Same event matcher across multiple components → inspect settings.json integration

When risk found → user explicit decision gate (no automatic patching)

### Step 6. Result Persistence (Optional)

**Canonical result file** (the "synergy reference file" referenced throughout this skill):

```
tracks/_meta/synergy_scan_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md      # local, gitignored by design
```

> **Detail**: See `SKILL_detail.md §Step6-Canon-Verification` — the 2026-08-11 check that picked the canonical result file over the playbook — read when doubting which file is the result canon.

**Residency**: a scan output enumerates the operator's installed components and mapped field
harnesses, which can carry company asset names. It belongs on a gitignored path only —
never append discovered pairs to a tracked file such as the playbook.

When persisting results:
- Record discovered synergy pairs in the canonical result file above
- Confirm absence of equivalent external tools (environment comparison verification)

### Step 7. Proactive Discovery — Proactive Mode

> Trigger: Runs when a new section/skill is registered in a user-maintained `LOCAL_SKILL_REGISTRY.md` (optional, user-created; absent → self-skip)

**Purpose**: FH proactively discovers and proposes synergies that previously required human ideas to find.

#### 7-1. Dynamically Discover and Read Registry Path

The registry is a **per-machine, gitignored** artifact (regenerated by the session scan). It therefore
lives in the **working project**, not in the plugin cache — a plugin install path ships no `.claude/`
directory at all, so searching only there yields a permanent false skip on every external install.

```bash
# Resolve FH install path (fallback root only). stderr is deliberately NOT discarded.
FH_INSTALL=$(python3 -c "
import json, pathlib
p = pathlib.Path.home() / '.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json'
if p.exists():
    data = json.loads(p.read_text())
    raw = data.get('plugins', data) if isinstance(data, dict) else data
    # version 2 = dict keyed by name; legacy = list of entries carrying 'name'
    items = raw.items() if isinstance(raw, dict) else [(e.get('name',''), [e]) for e in raw]
    for name, entries in items:
        entry = entries[0] if isinstance(entries, list) else entries
        if 'forge-harness' in name:
            print(entry.get('installPath',''))
            break
")
py_rc=$?

if [ "$py_rc" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "[HARNESS_ERROR] installed_plugins.json read failed (python rc=$py_rc)."
  echo "  Step 7 state = UNMEASURED. Do NOT report this as '[SKIP] no registry' — the inventory was never read."
else
  REGISTRY=""
  for CAND in "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}/.claude/registry/LOCAL_SKILL_REGISTRY.md" \
              "${FH_INSTALL:+$FH_INSTALL/.claude/registry/LOCAL_SKILL_REGISTRY.md}"; do
    if [ -n "$CAND" ] && [ -f "$CAND" ]; then REGISTRY="$CAND"; break; fi
  done
  if [ -n "$REGISTRY" ]; then
    cat "$REGISTRY"
  else
    echo "[NOT-CONFIGURED] LOCAL_SKILL_REGISTRY.md absent (searched \$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/registry/ then \$FH_INSTALL/.claude/registry/)."
    echo "  Create: mkdir -p \"\${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-\$PWD}/.claude/registry\" and write LOCAL_SKILL_REGISTRY.md there (per-machine, gitignored by design)."
  fi
fi
```

**Three outcomes, reported distinctly** (a missing measurement is not a zero):

| Outcome | Meaning | Step 7 body |
|---|---|---|
| registry printed | configured and read | run 7-2 ~ 7-5 |
| `[NOT-CONFIGURED]` | inventory read fine, no registry exists | skip 7-2 ~ 7-5, report this state + the creation hint |
| `[HARNESS_ERROR]` | inventory could not be read | skip 7-2 ~ 7-5, report **UNMEASURED** — never as a skip or a clean result |

If the registry was printed, extract `one-line description` + `example phrases` from newly registered projects/skills.

#### 7-2. Load Existing Synergy Pair List

Load already-registered synergy pairs (including ★ grade) → prevent duplicate proposals.

#### 7-3. Derive Undiscovered Synergy Candidates

Compare domain of new skill/project against entire existing registry:

| Decision criteria | Synergy grade candidate |
|---|---|
| Output of one becomes input of another | ★★★ |
| Different layers in same domain (generate↔analyze, build↔verify) | ★★★ |
| Can run sequentially in same cwd | ★★ |
| Domain overlap but different perspectives | ★ |

#### 7-4. Proactive Proposal Output Format

```
## Undiscovered Synergy Candidates (Proactive Detection)

| # | Pair | Grade Candidate | Discovery basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `{new skill}` ↔ `{existing skill}` | ★★★ | {one-line description} |

→ Add to the canonical result file (Step 6: `tracks/_meta/synergy_scan_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`)? [Y / N]
```

- **Y** → Append to that file as a new pair section (gitignored path only — see Step 6 Residency)
- **N** → Collect reason and discard or defer recording

#### 7-5. Guards

- 0 candidates → Output "No new synergy pairs found between newly registered skills and existing assets." then exit
- No duplicate proposals of already-registered pairs (cross-check with 7-2 load results)

## Done When

| Condition | Check class |
|---|---|
| Steps 1~6 completed | **mandatory-pass** |
| **Step 3-b reported as `run(n pairs)` or `skipped(<2 mapped tracks)`** — never silently omitted; read depth declared per track. 🟥 **The count comes from `bash scripts/mapped_tracks.sh`, and its `hub_root` / `in_worktree` line is quoted with the verdict** — a count taken by listing cwd is not evidence, it is the defect (main 11 vs worktree 1, measured 2026-08-22). `status=UNMEASURED` closes as `external-error`, **never** as `skipped` | **measured** (the count is a tool-call result, not a recollection) |
| **Step 3-c closes as exactly one of `run(ⓐ=N ⓑ=N ⓒ=N)` · `offered(whole-environment mode)` · `withheld(residency)`** — 🟥 **there is deliberately no open `skipped(<reason>)` value.** A free-text reason is an escape hatch: «skipped — pair obvious» would satisfy a presence check while doing none of the work. Deciding a lookup is unnecessary is not a skip, it is **ⓐ**, and it gets counted. A lookup or tool **failure** closes as `external-error` — a **NON-PASS**, never one of the three above | **mandatory-pass** |
| **Step 3-c pair ledger closes: `ⓐ + ⓑ + ⓒ + withheld == in-scope pair count`**, and ⓐ/ⓑ/ⓒ are assigned by tool-call evidence (none / local read / outward call), not by recollection | **measured** (counts come from the ledger and the session's tool history, not from memory) |
| **Step 3-c queries carried problem shapes, not harness/repo/path names** — and any pair that genuinely could not be abstracted is recorded as `withheld (residency)`, never dropped silently | **mandatory-pass** |
| **`harness-error` is a NON-PASS, not a third accepted state.** Reporting the error satisfies the anti-silence rule and nothing else — it does not clear this row. Surface it and stop; do not let a status string stand in for a result | **mandatory-pass** |
| Synergy ranking table (★~★★★) output | **mandatory-pass** |
| **Step 7 state reported as one of `run` / `not-configured` / `harness-error`** — never silently omitted, and `harness-error` never reported as a skip | **mandatory-pass** |
| Step 5 drift reported as `MATCH / DRIFTED / DRIFT-UNKNOWN(n=…)`, with `DRIFT-UNKNOWN` excluded from the match count; Step 2 `ABSENT` asset classes carried through as `ABSENT`, not `0` | **measured** (counts come from the Step 1/2 output, not from recall) |
| User explicit decision gate completed if risk catch items exist | **mandatory-pass** |
| Synergy grades are defensible (★ assignment per the Step 4 table) | **judged** — adversarial pairing: `fh-meta:challenger` re-reads the pair list and attacks each ★★★ for "would these two actually chain, or do they merely sound adjacent?" |
| User confirmed whether to persist results | **mandatory-pass** |

## Constraints

- No editing of external component asset bodies
- Automatic cross-invocation documentation / new risk avoidance rule creation = only on user's explicit decision
- For organization-specific environment examples, maintain a local reference file

# asset-placement-gate

Routes new skills, agents, and plugins to the correct location when proposed.

## Triggers
- "Should I make this an FH skill?"
- "Where should I put this agent?"
- When a new FH asset creation is proposed
- `/asset-placement-gate {asset name or description}`

### Natural Language Triggers (example user phrases)

When unsure where to place a new asset or skill:

| Example phrase | Intent |
|---|---|
| "Should I put this in a separate file?" | Asset necessity + placement decision |
| "Can this pattern be shared across projects?" | FH cross-project value assessment |
| "Is this only for our project, or can others use it too?" | cross-project vs local routing |
| "What if I turn this into a skill and use it across projects?" | FH 4-criteria trigger |
| "Where should I put this agent if I want to share it?" | Placement routing needed |
| "Should I extract this to a separate file, or leave it?" | Asset necessity + placement decision |
| "I'd like to manage this as a shared resource" | Cross-project shared management review |
| "Decide whether this stays local or is available to other teams too" | cross-project vs local routing |
| "I don't know where to save this" | Placement routing needed |
| "Should this become a shared asset?" | FH 4-criteria trigger |

### Execution Order (summary)

1. Request full file path from user (or accept natural language description)
2. Load asset content via `Read` (if path provided)
2.5. Step 0.5 mechanical overlap pre-scan (grounds criterion ④) + Step 0.6 official-corpora check (grounds criterion ③)
3. Evaluate Step 1 4-criteria in order (LLM makes the judgment, ④ gated on the Step 0.5 scan, ③ informed by Step 0.6)
4. ① + ④ both pass + at least one of ②③ passes → output **"FH suitable"**
   Otherwise, proceed to Step 2 local assessment → if fails, output **"Project-local agent or no asset needed"**

---

## Step 0. Parse Input + Fetch Asset

Immediately after trigger, acquire asset content in the following order.

1. **Path provided** (contains `.md` or starts with `/`): Read the file.
   - If read fails: "File not found. Please verify the path or provide a direct description." — then stop.
2. **Description provided** (natural language): Check whether all 3 fields can be identified:
   - **Purpose**: What this asset does (1 line)
   - **Trigger**: In what situation is it invoked?
   - **Expected callers**: Which project / which users will use it?

   All 3 identifiable → use as asset description.
   Any 1 unclear → stop with this question:
   > **The asset description is insufficient. Please provide:**
   > 1. Purpose of this asset (one line)
   > 2. In what situation is it invoked?
   > 3. Which project/users will primarily use it?
3. **No input**: Stop with the question below.
   > **Which asset should I evaluate?**
   > Enter a file path (e.g., `.claude/agents/jira-create.md`) or a description.

After acquiring the asset content, run Step 0.5 (mechanical overlap pre-scan) and Step 0.6 (official-corpora check) **before** the judged Step 1.

## Step 0.5. Mechanical Overlap Pre-Scan (grounds criterion ④)

Criterion ④ ("no overlap with existing FH skills") is otherwise an LLM **recall** judgment with no
ground truth — a duplicate skill with a novel name passes because the judge has no enumerated list to
check against (judge-robustness swarm, 2026-06-13). Ground it mechanically first:

Run this in **Bash** from the FH repo root (the pipeline below is `grep | grep -v | grep -c`, which the
Grep tool cannot express).

```bash
# LEG A — enumerate existing skill names + descriptions (grounds the judged comparison).
# This leg is ALSO the liveness check for leg B: a dead scan and a genuine no-collision both
# produce collision-count 0, so the enumerate count must be read FIRST.
ROSTER="$(grep -riE 'name:|description:' plugins/fh-meta/skills/*/SKILL.md plugins/fh-commons/skills/*/SKILL.md)"
ROSTER_N="$(printf '%s' "$ROSTER" | grep -c . )"
echo "roster_entries=$ROSTER_N"
if [ "$ROSTER_N" -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "SCAN_DEAD — enumerate leg returned 0 rows (wrong cwd / missing plugins tree / glob did not match)."
  echo "Criterion ④ = UNDETERMINED. Do NOT read this as 'no collision'. Fix the cwd and re-run."
  # fail-closed: stop here, do not run leg B, do not pass ④
fi
# LEG B — hard-collision check (run ONLY when ROSTER_N > 0).
# WHOLE proposed name or a WHOLE trigger phrase reused verbatim.
# grep -wF (whole-word, fixed-string) on the full strings — NOT -E on tokens (a shared common
# word like "review" is not a collision). Exclude the asset's own file (self-match = false hit).
SELF="plugins/fh-meta/skills/PROPOSED_NAME/SKILL.md"
grep -rwF -e "PROPOSED_FULL_NAME" -e "FULL_TRIGGER_PHRASE_1" -e "FULL_TRIGGER_PHRASE_2" \
     plugins/*/skills/*/SKILL.md | grep -v "$SELF" | grep -c .
```

(Replace the `PROPOSED_*` / `FULL_TRIGGER_*` tokens with the literal strings under evaluation.)

Surface **roster_entries + collision count + nearest existing skill(s)** — the roster count is part of
the report, not a private step: `collision=0` is only meaningful next to a non-zero `roster_entries`
(not-found ≠ zero). Criterion ④ then passes only if **`roster_entries` > 0 AND 0 whole-name/
whole-trigger collision AND the judged ≤90%-overlap check agrees**. `roster_entries = 0` is
`SCAN_DEAD` → ④ **UNDETERMINED** (fail-closed), never a pass. A verbatim whole-name or
whole-trigger reuse is a hard ④ fail regardless of the LLM judgment. **Honest scope**: the grep grounds
*literal* name/trigger reuse only — a post-cutoff duplicate with a *paraphrased* trigger is invisible to
both the judge (cutoff) and the grep (literal); that residual leans on the judged half **fed the
enumerated descriptions above** (grounded comparison, not pure memory), not on full mechanization. A
shared common word is a judged-review flag, **not** a hard fail.

**External grounding (2026-09-14 frontier signal, citation verified live before inclusion)**: Saha,
Faghih & Feizi, *"Under the Hood of SKILL.md: Semantic Supply-chain Attacks on AI Agent Skill
Registry"* (arXiv:2605.11418, May 2026 — https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.11418). Using real registry
mechanisms (not a hypothetical), it measures SKILL.md-only attacks that manipulate which skill gets
**discovered** (adversarial phrasing wins embedding-retrieval visibility: up to 86% pairwise win rate,
80% Top-10 placement) and **selected** (description-only framing biases the agent toward a
functionally-equivalent adversarial variant in 77.6% of paired trials on average). This is external
confirmation that the paraphrase/semantic gap named just above — the grep grounds *literal* reuse
only — sits on a measured admission-time attack surface, not a theoretical edge case. **This note does
not close the residual**: no new mechanized check is added here, and none should be added by an
autonomous pass — a `steel-quench` Wave scoped to adversarial (not merely accidental) trigger/description
framing is a candidate follow-up, but the gate-design decision belongs to human review
(§Mechanization Boundary — judgment stays with evolution).

## Step 0.6. Tier-0/1 Official-Corpora Check (grounds criterion ③)

Besides the FH roster (Step 0.5), check the proposal against the official corpora: platform
built-ins, `claude-plugins-official`, and the **Claude Cookbook pattern list**
(platform.claude.com/cookbook — agent patterns · tools · RAG · evals · skills). A hit here is a
**judged ③ flag, not an automatic ③ fail**: it obliges the proposal to state its governance
increment over the official pattern (no-reinvention rule — an official pattern that fully covers
the need outranks a net-new build; a pattern the proposal governs *on top of* does not fail ③).
Offline fallback: note `cookbook: unchecked` **in the Step 3 routing output** rather than silently
skipping. (Provenance: `tracks/_audit/session_2026_07_25_claude5-context-rules-sister.md`.)

## Done When

Each condition declares its check class (mandatory-pass / measured / judged); every judged condition
names its adversarial pairing — no judge-only path.

```
All steps 0–3 completed
  (mandatory-pass — each step's output block is present; a skipped step is a FAIL, not a default pass)
+ Step 0.5 scan is LIVE: roster_entries > 0
  (measured: the reported roster_entries count. 0 = SCAN_DEAD → criterion ④ UNDETERMINED and this
   skill is NOT done — a dead scan and a genuine no-collision both read 0 collisions, so the
   liveness number is what separates them)
+ Step 3 routing result output (location: FH meta-skill / local agent / drop)
  (judged — adversarial pairing: `fh-meta:challenger` re-argues the case for the destination that was
   NOT chosen, citing the 4 criteria; a routing verdict that survives the opposite case passes, an
   unopposed one does not)
+ Next action specified (write SKILL.md / create .claude/agents/ / none)
  (mandatory-pass — a literal next-action string from that enum; blank or "TBD" does not satisfy it)
```

## Step 1. FH Meta-Skill 4-Criteria Evaluation

| # | Criterion | Evaluation Question |
|:-:|---|---|
| ① | Cross-project value | Is this asset equally useful in other projects without depending on a specific project? |
| ② | Orchestration / judgment layer | Is it just a list of MCP/Bash calls, or a judgment layer that synthesizes multiple signals? |
| ③ | Not replaceable by built-ins | Can this be equally achieved with direct MCP calls or basic bash? (If yes, fails this criterion.) A Step 0.6 official-pattern hit is a judged flag: fails ③ only if the pattern fully covers the need with no governance increment |
| ④ | No overlap with existing FH skills | Step 0.5 mechanical scan = 0 name/trigger collision **AND** judged ≤90% overlap. Non-zero collision → hard fail. |

**FH suitable** → ① + ④ both pass + at least one of ②③ passes.
**Fail** → ① or ④ fails → immediate fail. Or both ②③ fail → proceed to Step 2.

---

## Step 2. Project-Local Agent Value Assessment

For assets that failed Step 1:

| # | Criterion | Evaluation Question |
|:-:|---|---|
| A | Project-specific knowledge | Does it encode paths, conventions, or domain rules specific to a project? |
| B | Repeated workflow pattern | Is it a workflow performed repeatedly within that project? |
| C | Differentiation from built-ins | Does it provide local-context-based convenience such as automatic convention application or step integration? |

**Local agent suitable** → A satisfied + at least one of B·C.
→ Recommend creating `{project}/.claude/agents/{name}.md`.

**Drop** → A not satisfied or both B·C not satisfied.
→ Equivalent to built-in capability. No asset needed.

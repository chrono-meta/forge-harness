# deep-clarify — Socratic Requirement Clarification

A skill that clarifies vague or open-ended requests through conversation to produce **actionable spec documents**.
An independent extension of the "direction confirmation" protocol from agent-composer Step 0-a.

## Triggers

- `/deep-clarify`
- "I don't know what to build", "How should I approach this?"
- "Organize the requirements", "Write a spec document"
- "What should I do with this?", "The direction is unclear"
- When agent-composer detects pre-dispatch clarification is needed and delegates automatically

## Core Principles

**Criteria for asking vs inferring**:
- Things only the human can know (goal, priorities, constraints, completion criteria) → ask
- Things AI can infer (implementation method, file location, technology choices) → infer and present as `(inferred: X)`
- Questions: **maximum 3 rounds, maximum 2 questions per round** — do not overuse

---

## Step 1. Request Analysis

Quickly identify the following from the user's request.

```
Clarity check:
□ Final state (what will be different when done?) — ask if unclear
□ Completion criteria (how will it be verified?) — ask if unclear
□ Constraints (what must not be done, what must not be touched) — ask if unclear
□ Priority (fast vs thorough, now vs later) — ask if unclear
```

**Direct entry conditions** (skip to Step 3 without questions):
- Request is specific and completion criteria are clear → draft spec document and confirm
- Clarity at the level of "add Y feature to file X"

---

## Step 2. Socratic Dialogue

### Round 1 — Goal / Completion Criteria (core 2 questions)

```
Clarification needed.

1. Completion criteria: What does a completed [task name] look like?
   (inferred: [inferred completion criteria] — confirm if correct)

2. Scope: Which of [A / B / C] takes priority?
   (inferred: [inferred choice] — reason: [rationale])
```

### Round 2 — Constraints / Priority (only if needed)

Skip if Round 1 resolves everything.

```
1. Is there anything this task must absolutely not do?
2. Which takes priority: fast completion vs solid design?
```

### Round 3 — Final Confirmation (only if needed)

Draft the spec first, then single confirmation: "Is this the right direction?"

---

## Step 3. Generate Spec Document

Structure and save the results of the conversation.

```bash
# Save path
.claude/specs/{task-slug}.md
```

### Spec Document Format

```markdown
# Spec: {task title}
Created: {date} | Status: draft

## Goal
{One sentence — what is being built and why}

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] {verifiable condition 1}
- [ ] {verifiable condition 2}

## Scope
Included: {what is explicitly included}
Excluded: {what is explicitly excluded}

## Constraints
- {technical constraint}
- {what must not be done}

## Priority
{Fast completion / Solid design / Balanced} — {reason}

## References
{related files / existing skills / prerequisite work}
```

---

## Step 4. Follow-up Connections

After generating the spec document, suggest the appropriate next path:

| Situation | Connected skill |
|---|---|
| Agent orchestration needed for implementation | `agent-composer` — pass spec document path |
| Plan / design review needed | `plan` agent — build plan based on spec |
| Single task is now clear | Start implementation directly |
| Audit needed before external sharing | `hub-persona-auditor` |

---

## Done When

| Condition | Completion verdict |
|---|---|
| Socratic dialogue complete + spec document saved | ✅ Clarification complete |
| Spec path output: `.claude/specs/{slug}.md` | ✅ Save complete |
| Follow-up skill connection suggestion output | ✅ Handoff complete |

**This skill's Done When = "actionable spec document saved".** Implementation itself is the domain of follow-up agents/skills.

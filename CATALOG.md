### 2026-06-05 | _audit | sister-asset, gstack, field-harness, garry-tan
**File:** tracks/_audit/session_2026_06_05_gstack-sister.md (private companion mirror)
gstack (garrytan, ~66K stars) sister-asset cross-audit — the field/execution-harness counterpart to FH's meta/governance harness, both running on the Claude Code skill substrate. FH governs / gstack executes (composes, not competes). Bidirectional import (frictionless one-command install, opinionated front door, privacy-first telemetry) / propagate (post-ship governance gate, cross-project knowledge compounding, HITL promotion gate) lists recorded.
- Decision: public index only — bet evidence (B1·ID·SB) + full audit held in private store; external cross-link proposal to garrytan/gstack gated behind 3+ persona × 4-axis audit.

### 2026-06-04 | forge-harness | #skill, #public-private-split, #leak-prevention, #composability-gate
**File:** plugins/fh-meta/skills/public-surface-audit/SKILL.md
New meta-skill: scans git-tracked files for operator-private tokens (real username, absolute home paths, companion-store name, company asset names) that belong only in gitignored files. Closes the surface-sweep gap from the Gap-1 public/private split. Dogfoods its own rule — patterns live in a gitignored source, SKILL.md carries only placeholders.
- Decision: tracked-only scan (git ls-files); configurable pattern table + tight allowlist; severity HIGH/MED/LOW.
- Open: skill-count drift across plugin.json / local_fh_context (separate cleanup).

### 2026-06-04 | forge-harness | #issue-69, #field-harvest, #mode-b, #detection-skip
**File:** plugins/fh-meta/skills/field-harvest/SKILL.md
Mode B extension (Proposal A): session-end auto-proposal for un-logged field-cwd commits (item1), detection-skip for already-logged commits (item2), templates/ hub-link footer (item6).
- Decision: auto-trigger is proposal-only (no auto-run); harvest-loop keeps hub-cwd wrap-up ownership (collision guard).
- Open: item2 bash detection-skip style pending sister-hub reply (inline-grep vs persisted-ledger).

### 2026-06-04 | forge-harness | #4-axis-gate, #pre-commit-hook, #docs-scope
**File:** templates/.git-hooks/pre-commit
4-axis gate scope extension: docs/*.md + AGENTS.md added to the substantive carve-out (Axes 2-3 when diff adds fence/citation/version). Also implemented the previously-documented-but-missing knowledge/ carve-out in the hook. Gate hook activated (core.hooksPath → templates/.git-hooks; was physically inactive).
- Decision: path-regex carve-out bucket + diff_is_substantive() helper.
- Open: none.

### 2026-06-03 | forge-harness | #goal-quench, #native-validation, #calibration, #stop-hook
**File:** tracks/_meta/goal_quench_2026-06-03.md
Run #1 native goal-quench validation (core mode): Stop hook `.active` → `.pending` confirmed working. pipeline-conductor --quick CLEAN (Step 3 ESCALATE resolved via option(a) inline fix).
- Decision: GREEN estimate missed pipeline-conductor overhead (~6K); timestamp field used literal "now" — fixed to `date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"` going forward.

### 2026-06-03 | forge-harness | #context-bridge-dispatch, #done-when, #deprecated, #source-grounding
**File:** plugins/fh-meta/skills/context-bridge-dispatch/SKILL.md
Added Done When section (satisfies harness-doctor L2 M-tier for deprecated skill). Replaced informal "completeness gate" term with "L2 M-tier (CLAUDE.md §New Skill Creation Pre-Commit Gate)". All 22 fh-meta SKILL.md files now have Done When.
- Decision: deprecated skills still require Done When — `deprecated: true` is not an exemption from the pre-commit gate.

### 2026-06-03 | forge-harness | #goal-quench, #calibration, #run2, #catalog
**File:** CATALOG.md
Run #2 native goal-quench validation (core mode): added 3 CATALOG entries for today's session work. Established pipeline-conductor overhead correction (~6K) for GREEN-tier estimates.

### 2026-06-03 | forge-harness | #goal-quench, #install-wizard, #calibration-schema, #done-when, #skill-evolution
**File:** plugins/fh-meta/skills/goal-quench/SKILL.md, plugins/fh-meta/skills/install-wizard/SKILL.md
PR #67: Calibration schema extended with `run_id`, `session_id`, `scope_hint` fields (R10 schema gaps). Phase 1.5 hand-off clarified: "update not re-create" `.active` file to preserve `start_commit`. install-wizard: Done When section added (6-step gate + `--dry-run` variant) — only active skill of 28 missing it (R07 M-tier).
- Decision: schema fields added prospectively — backfilling retrospective N=10 rows with `mode`/`session_type` is a local companion-store task, not a SKILL.md change

### 2026-06-03 | forge-harness | #catalog, #goal-quench, #skill-evolution
**File:** CATALOG.md
PR #66: Added CATALOG entries for PRs #61–64 (goal-quench evolution arc): mode-ladder refactor, micro R-tier cleanup, non-coercive guidance formalization, scope-driven sidecar routing + 4.7× overhead calibration.
- Decision: tracks/** gitignored by design — calibration YAML records stay local; only CATALOG.md committed

### 2026-06-03 | forge-harness | #goal-quench, #sidecar-routing, #step-d, #deprecated-refs, #return-path
**File:** plugins/fh-meta/skills/goal-quench/SKILL.md, plugins/fh-meta/skills/install-wizard/SKILL.md, plugins/fh-meta/skills/frontier-digest/SKILL.md, plugins/fh-meta/skills/harvest-loop/SKILL.md
PR #65: Fixed Step D return-path bug (all 3 sidecar chains were fire-and-forget → added Step 3-c blocking verdict gate). Added `estimation_error_pct` field to calibration schema. Removed 4 deprecated routing refs: `context-bridge-dispatch` (install-wizard Cluster C + frontier-digest core skills list) and `/self-marketing-lint` (harvest-loop P10 → `/harness-doctor --lint`). ESCALATE added to Done When conditions.
- Decision: Step 3-c gate is blocking (not advisory) — sidecar verdict must resolve before Done When

### 2026-06-03 | forge-harness | #goal-quench, #sidecar-routing, #token-calibration, #steel-quench, #skill-evolution
**File:** plugins/fh-meta/skills/goal-quench/SKILL.md
PR #64: Added scope-driven sidecar routing (Step D) to goal-quench Phase 1.5: task-type signals auto-route to steel-quench C3 (code review), agent-composer panel (architecture), or sim-conductor+steel-quench Wave 5 (external publish). Formalized session overhead calibration at 4.7× factor (N=10), adding `session_type`, `actual_vs_estimate_ratio`, and `sidecar` fields to the calibration schema. Resolved steel-quench meta-audit S+A+B findings: sub-goal loop rewritten as user-driven queue, pre-flight check added, Opus escalation cost disclosed.
- Decision: overhead multiplier documented as empirical calibration constant; sidecar routing is scope-signal-driven, not mode-locked

### 2026-06-03 | forge-harness | #goal-quench, #non-coercive, #companion-store, #ephemeral-handoff
**File:** .claude/rules/modes_and_value.md
Formalized two non-coercive guidances: companion-store recommendation conditioned on accumulating context into meta-harness without a local fork; ephemeral-environment handoff rule made mode-agnostic (Mode D → companion-store handoff/, all others → committed note or PR comment in working repo).
- Decision: single-source preserved — rule lives in public mirror; companion store holds only outputs, never a rule copy

### 2026-06-03 | forge-harness | #goal-quench, #skill-evolution, #meta-audit, #prompt-regression
**File:** plugins/fh-meta/skills/goal-quench/SKILL.md
Post-merge micro R-tier cleanup: corrected two prompt-regression probe expectations mis-FAILing correct skills (P-CHAIN-01/02). Made LOCAL_SKILL_REGISTRY trigger in cross-ecosystem-synergy-detection honestly optional. Closes full-harness refactor backlog.
- Decision: leftover placeholder bash blocks and challenger wiring gap are verified non-defects

### 2026-06-03 | forge-harness | #goal-quench, #skill-evolution, #mode-ladder, #sidecar-routing
**File:** plugins/fh-meta/skills/goal-quench/SKILL.md
Evolved goal-quench into a fluid core→pro→max mode ladder. Core: token-budget-gate + pipeline-conductor --quick; pro: +context-doctor +agent-composer; max: +plugin-recommender +cross-ecosystem-synergy-detection. Phase-1 budget verdict auto-recommends mode. Ran full-harness dogfood sweep (33 skills): fixed phantom refs, dead blocks, stale agent forks (4 deleted), trigger collision, and 3 skill-splitter splits.
- Decision: RED tier reframed as max-mode decomposition on-ramp, not hard block

### 2026-06-02 | _audit | sister-asset, token-efficiency, compression, headroom
**File:** tracks/_audit/session_2026_06_02_headroom_context_doctor.md
Cross-audited Headroom (Netflix engineer's OSS token-compression tool, vendor-reported 60–95% reduction) against context-doctor's Compression Pass per sister_asset_protocol. Same goal, different layer: Headroom is the runtime executor FH lacks; context-doctor is the judgment Headroom lacks — they compose.
- Decision: import redundancy-category targeting heuristic (MCP outputs ~70% → logs ~90% → DB → file trees) into context-doctor + name Headroom as the production-proven local option; no clone-and-own (reference + record only)
- Open: actual proxy/agent-wrap routing is a local runtime setup (outside the FH repo); v0.22 maturity — pilot first

### 2026-06-02 | frontier-digest, identity, propagation | harness-engineering, a2a, mcp, observability, context
**File:** knowledge/shared/harness-core/harness_frontier_diagnosis_2026-06-02.md
Frontier digest anchored on FH's 3-layer identity + Core Axis (WebSearch engine; curl blocked, no API key). 2026-06 signal: "Harness Engineering" named 4th AI-engineering paradigm (65% of AI failures = harness defects); A2A Agent Cards + MCP registry standardize agent discovery; AHE thesis — observability is the self-improvement bottleneck.
- Decision: 6 strengthening candidates mapped per identity (agent-card registry + dispatch overhead budget → ①; harness-defect taxonomy + observability/eval hooks → ②; L1/L2/L3 context hierarchy + compression pass → ③)
- Open: candidates are proposals only — none implemented yet. Raw signal + processing checklist held in a private companion store, not this public repo.

### 2026-05-31 | multi-model, sidecar, adversarial, validated | orchestrator-swap, perspective-diversity, cross-cli
**File:** knowledge/shared/harness-core/multi_model_sidecar_strategy.md
외부 모델(Gemini/Codex/Copilot CLI)을 Claude Code/FH 세션 안에서 Bash tool로 sidecar 호출하는 검증된 패턴. Experiment 1(직접 sidecar 호출) + Experiment 2(3-round orchestrator-swap)로 실증 — 각 orchestrator가 비중복 findings 발견, cross-wave delta가 convergence를 개선. perspective diversity(1순위)·model-access fallback(2순위)·token economy(3순위). §Mechanism: agent dispatch 아닌 stateless 서브프로세스.
- Decision: 하네스가 multi-model synthesis의 activation condition — sidecar는 quality compounding 메커니즘이지 단순 coverage 체크 아님

### 2026-05-31 | anti-bias, multi-team, adversarial, token-coverage | steel-quench, sim-conductor, experiment, v2-paper
**File:** tracks/_meta/fh_multiteam_token_coverage_2026_05_31.md
Experiment 5 — Multi-Team Adversarial Panel measured on phantom-quench SKILL.md. 4 conditions (C1 single / C2 cross-session / C3 +gemini / C4 codex-TTY-fail=C3). Key results: C1→25% coverage, C2→75%, C3→100%. Claude blind spots: 3 findings (25% of total), 1 S-grade. Claude-side cost C2→C3: +0 tokens (H3 validated — Gemini billed to separate quota). Codex CLI present but headless-inoperable. Updated steel-quench/sim-conductor/phantom-quench/harness-doctor/harvest-loop with Multi-Team Panel design + human gates + synthesizer cross-session. v2 paper Experiment 5 section drafted with full metrics table.
- Decision: decision rule confirmed — routine→C2 (cross-session), pre-publish→C3+ (zero Claude overhead)
### 2026-05-31 | synergy, integration, playbook | opencode, hermes, openhuman, governance, marketing
**File:** knowledge/shared/harness-core/fh_synergy_playbook.md
Concrete workflow specifications for using FH with OpenCode/Hermes/OpenHuman — grounded only in recorded experiments. Three patterns: (1) OpenCode: fh-gate.sh after code gen → DONE→PENDING flip, 2 A-grade on arity.ts; (2) Hermes: skill audit before dispatch → 2 A-grade pre-exec/credential gaps; (3) OpenHuman: Memory Tree staleness audit → GROUNDED/STALE/BROKEN verdict. Includes honest finding-rate estimates, "no integration required" value prop, and compounding effect explanation.
- Decision: no unverified claims — every stated outcome traces to a specific experiment or structural guarantee

### 2026-05-31 | integration-contract, bridge-layer, governance-interface | opencode, hermes, openhuman, v2-paper
**File:** knowledge/shared/harness-core/fh_integration_contract.md
Formal v0.1 specification for how callers (OpenCode, Hermes, OpenHuman, CI) invoke FH governance gates and receive structured verdicts. Defines: input format (newline-separated files), FH_STATUS+verdict format, findings in YAML block, parse recipe. Includes caller-specific guidance + Stop hook pattern + record spec. Gemini adversarial review found 2 A-grade issues (space-separated paths, non-parseable multi-line fields) — both fixed in v0.1. Also includes `scripts/fh-gate.sh` prompt-generator wrapper.
- Decision: findings use YAML block (not flat key-value) to prevent delimiter ambiguity; FH_STATUS mandatory for fail-safe parsing

### 2026-05-31 | opencode, governance, usage-guide, synergy | pipeline-conductor, steel-quench, v2-paper
**File:** knowledge/shared/harness-core/fh_opencode_governance_wrapper.md
Step-by-step usage guide for FH + OpenCode governance integration. 3-step protocol (diff capture → steel-quench → pipeline-conductor). No API adapter required. Includes empirical baseline from arity.ts trial: CI=DONE, FH governance=PENDING, 2 A-grade security-adjacent findings caught. Stop hook automation pattern included.
- Decision: governance wrapper documented as protocol (not API) — FH reads files OpenCode writes

### 2026-05-31 | v2-paper, opencode, governance, controlled-experiment | steel-quench, pipeline-conductor, synergy
**File:** tracks/_meta/fh_opencode_governance_experiment_2026_05_31.md
FH governance (steel-quench + pipeline-conductor --quick) applied to OpenCode's AI-generated `arity.ts`. Baseline: CI green, DONE. FH governance: PENDING — 2 A-grade findings (short-token overflow in permission allowlist, npx/opencode missing from arity table) + 1 B-grade. Delta not attributable to model — attributable to methodology layer. v2 paper prototype: controlled experiment evidence for N-fold synergy claim.
- Decision: governance layer catches issues CI misses; arity.ts short-token overflow is permission-critical and untested

### 2026-05-30 | fh-meta | edit-manifest, predict-verify, validation-gate, skill-evolution, SkillOpt, AHE
**File:** plugins/fh-meta/skills/edit-manifest/SKILL.md
New skill: predict-verify loop for harness edits. Every SKILL.md/rules/CLAUDE.md edit records a falsifiable prediction; next session verifies against actual outcomes. Validation gate (SkillOpt pattern) accepts only edits with measurable improvement; rejected edits retained as negative-feedback buffer. Integrated as harvest-loop Step 0-c.
- Decision: based on AHE (arXiv:2604.25850) change manifest + SkillOpt (arXiv:2605.23904) selection-split gate

### 2026-05-30 | fh-meta | memory-hygiene, stale-memory, staleness-detection, verification
**File:** plugins/fh-meta/skills/memory-hygiene/SKILL.md
New skill: detects "stale-but-confident" memory entries (facts verified once but silently drifted). Classifies by type (project 14d / reference 30d / feedback 90d / user 180d), re-verifies live via gh CLI or WebFetch (FH online advantage), proposes archival. Integrated as harvest-loop Step 0-c.
- Decision: based on Scaling the Harness (arXiv:2605.26112) §3.2 stale-but-confident failure mode

### 2026-05-29 | harness-core | return-path-gate, skill-chain, conditional-pass, closed-loop
**File:** knowledge/shared/harness-core/return_path_gate.md
Pattern: downstream skill returns structured verdict (PASS/CONDITIONAL_PASS/FAIL/ESCALATE) back to caller, which gates next step on it. Verified in apex-review→sim-conductor and agent-composer↔deliberation.
- Decision: promoted to knowledge/shared/ — same pattern appeared independently in 2 skill pairs

### 2026-05-29 | harness-core | meta-harness-engineering, definition, frontier, academic-convergence
**File:** knowledge/shared/harness-core/meta_harness_engineering_definition.md
Formal definition of meta harness engineering + FH positioning vs. academic convergence (arXiv 2605.18747 "Code as Agent Harness", arXiv 2604.14228 98.4% finding). Maps FH 6-axis to 3-layer taxonomy; distinguishes human-in-loop (FH) vs automation-first vs automation-maximalist approaches.
- Decision: FH differentiator = human judgment gate on all PRs, not automation maximization

### 2026-05-29 | fh-commons | token-budget-gate, token-estimation, cost-guard, multi-agent
**File:** plugins/fh-commons/skills/token-budget-gate/SKILL.md
New skill: pre-task token cost estimation with Green/Yellow/Orange/Red gate verdict. Post-task calibration loop improves future estimates. Auto-proposed before agent-composer, sim-conductor, steel-quench, harvest-loop.
- Decision: placed in fh-commons (project-agnostic, useful before any expensive multi-agent task)
- Thresholds: <10K green / 10-30K yellow / 30-60K orange / >60K red (user-configurable)

### 2026-05-29 | fh-commons | mcp-circuit-breaker, mcp-reliability, tool-failure, fallback
**File:** plugins/fh-commons/skills/mcp-circuit-breaker/SKILL.md
New skill: detects MCP tool failure patterns (3 consecutive fails = trip), blocks further calls, proposes 3-tier fallbacks, and resets via HALF-OPEN probe after cooldown.
- Decision: placed in fh-commons (project-agnostic MCP guard, useful in any Claude Code project)
- Circuit states: CLOSED → OPEN → HALF-OPEN → CLOSED

### 2026-05-29 | fh-meta | prompt-regression, regression-detection, harness-quality
**File:** plugins/fh-meta/skills/prompt-regression/SKILL.md
New skill: detects harness behavioral regressions after CLAUDE.md / rule / skill edits by running standard probe suite and comparing against baselines.
- Decision: placed in fh-meta (harness-specific behavioral testing, not general-purpose)
- Chain: FAIL verdict → harness-doctor → verify-bidirectional

### 2026-05-28 | _meta | install-wizard, plugin-autoinstall, deprecated-cleanup, fh-ops, external-validation
**File:** tracks/_meta/session_2026_05_28_fh-external-ops.md
First external run of FH — install-wizard (score 57/100) revealed 2 friction points, both fixed immediately. PR #7 (plugin auto-install) + PR #8 (deprecated refs cleanup) merged.
- Decision: install-wizard FH plugin MISS → AI auto-runs via Bash (eliminates 3-turn manual flow) — "friction only visible when the builder actually uses it" pattern
- Decision: deprecated refs must be updated alongside CHANGELOG — separate cleanup PR required

### 2026-05-27 | _meta | two-layer-storage, memory-vs-tracks, cross-session-state
**File:** tracks/_meta/fh_signal_2026_05_27_session-starter.md
Two-layer storage principle formalized: `tracks/` = local work history (machine-bound), `memory/` = critical cross-session state (durable, survives re-clone). Gap: session starter files in tracks/ are lost on machine change.
- Decision: Critical cross-session state must also be written to `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/` — tracks/ alone is insufficient for durability

### 2026-05-26 | _audit | sister-asset, harness-evolver, meta-harness, stanford, arxiv
**File:** tracks/_audit/session_2026_05_26_harness_evolver.md
Sister asset cross-audit — harness-evolver (raphaelchristi) + Meta-Harness (Lee et al., arXiv:2603.28052, Stanford IRIS Lab). Independent architectural convergence confirmed: outer-loop field observation → adversarial critique → synthesis → integration → verification. Cross-reference links proposed; Issue #26 filed.
- Decision: harness-evolver = direct complement (automation-first) vs FH (knowledge-accumulation-first) — mutual citation proposed

### 2026-05-26 | _audit | sister-asset, sylph-ai, arxiv, simplification-principle
**File:** tracks/_audit/session_2026_05_26_sylph_sister.md
Sister asset cross-audit — "The Last Harness You'll Ever Build" (Sylph.AI, arXiv:2604.21003). Title resonates with FH simplification principle but approach diverges: Sylph = fully automated adversarial agent loops, FH = human-in-the-loop curated knowledge evolution.
- Decision: Sylph.AI = automation-maximalist counterpart; FH distinction is human judgment layer

### 2026-05-26 | _meta | external-network, wave3-validation, sase, install-wizard, frontier-digest
**File:** tracks/_meta/external_network_verification_2026_05_26.md
Wave 3 meta-validation: confirmed all previously restricted-network-blocked capabilities work on a standard network — install-wizard dry-run, plugin-recommender live GitHub search, frontier-digest fetch, git push. Baseline for external user environment parity.
- Decision: All core FH capabilities verified functional on a standard (unrestricted) network

### 2026-05-26 | forge-harness | v1.2, public-release, harness-evolver-absorb
**File:** tracks/_meta/reference_next_session_starter.md
v1.2 release complete (PR #1–#5): harvest-loop Step 0, agent-composer worktree isolation, steel-quench numeric scoring, README positioning. Repo made public.
- Decision: harness-evolver 3대 혁신 흡수 — regression guard / worktree isolation / numeric scoring

## Reference Documents

<!-- Time-independent reference documents -->

### 2026-04-28 | template | maturity-roadmap, 3-phase-frame, frontier-tracking, simplification-gate
**File:** `knowledge/shared/harness-core/hub_maturity_roadmap.md`
Hub long-term evolution path frame. Phase I (entering maturity) → Phase II (frontier following (b)cadence) → Phase III (leading) 3-stage model + 5-criteria gate (audit automation·operations guide·external propagation·sub-agent judgment·self-diagnosis warning) + 6 indicators (seed repo·blog·citations·external adoption·self-evolving·industry original) + simplification gate (self-diagnosis + within 200 lines + unreferenced archive at each transition). General-purpose template derived from first verified operating instance.
- Decision: (b) quarterly + monthly cadence recommended — if adopting other option, need to prove simplification gate passed
- Decision: Phase III has no completion (ongoing state) — 3+ of 6 indicators continuously rising is the maintenance condition
- Decision: Phase regression allowed — do not force linear progression (allow partial Phase I redo if frontier following routine is missed)

## Skills

### 2026-05-08 | fh-meta | harvest-loop, weekly-audit, self-evolution-pipeline, session-harvest, phase-2-plus
**File:** plugins/fh-meta/skills/harvest-loop/SKILL.md
Self-evolution pipeline — field-harvest → contention-layer → devil/innovator parallel → synthesizer → Critic Agent → harness-doctor → verify-bidirectional → curator (8 steps). Lightweight mode for weekly audit. Replaces deprecated audit-learnings.
- Decision: harvest-loop = audit-learnings successor + full self-evolution pipeline integrated

### 2026-05-08 | fh-meta | verify-bidirectional, layer-5-cross-verification, conscious-self-activation, diff-gate
**File:** plugins/fh-meta/skills/verify-bidirectional/SKILL.md
Bidirectional self-verification pattern automation — when user's precision counter-argument manifests after AI recommendation/agreement persistence, baseline update channel 6-step processing.
- Decision: v0.5 official release — accumulated runs + mode C correction catch fully persisted

### 2026-05-08 | fh-meta | hub-cc-pr-reviewer, command-tower-gate-automation, baseline-coherence-check, layer-5-self-catch
**File:** plugins/fh-meta/skills/hub-cc-pr-reviewer/SKILL.md
Command Tower Gate operations rule automation — on PR input, auto-generates baseline coherence check 8-matrix + Layer 5 self-catch matrix + review comment attachment + admin override merge recommendation.
- Decision: v0.1 newly created — PR lifecycle 4-run accumulated + explicit decision trigger met

### 2026-05-20 | fh-meta | context-bridge-dispatch, agent-view-context-blindness, parallel-dispatch, session-context-card
**File:** plugins/fh-meta/skills/context-bridge-dispatch/SKILL.md
Parallel agent dispatch pre-session context card injection pattern automation — sub-agents read files but cannot access main session living context. Context Card (purpose·completed·this agent's task·caution) generation and injection into each prompt before 2+ parallel dispatches. Simple file lookup agents can omit.
- Decision: v0.1 newly created — agent view blindspot captured in the field → FH skill decision

## Agents

### 2026-05-08 | fh-meta | hub-persona-auditor, persona-simulation, three-tier-revision, external-asset-pre-publication
**File:** plugins/fh-meta/agents/hub-persona-auditor.md
External-facing asset (briefing·card·public guide) pre-publication persona audit — 3+ virtual reader persona simulation + 4-axis (resonance·confusion·resistance·supplement) review + 3-tier (mandatory·strong·recommended) revision proposals.
- Decision: fh-meta agent separate operation (not a skill / external-facing cadence activation)

### 2026-05-08 | fh-meta | fact-checker, hub-asset-grep-verification, duplicate-detection, stale-fact-detection
**File:** plugins/fh-meta/agents/fact-checker.md
Hub asset grep verification — (1) hub asset duplicate check before recommending new asset/skill/agent (2) stale data detection in memory/docs (3) when duplicate work is suspected.
- Decision: hub self-review circuit baseline established
